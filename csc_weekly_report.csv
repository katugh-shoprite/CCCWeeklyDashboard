I often sit and have a cup of coffee or your special at the little coffee shop and have always enjoyed it.  The lady serving is lovely BUT.    Today it was terrible.   Only 3 tables available.   One that I could have had staff were sitting around, I asked if I could have that table please, as I am a pensioner and waited for another person to finish shopping.    This is becoming a staff canteen more and more.   On another table staff interviews were held, with staff shouting on top of their voices.  All the staff come in there to pay for their purchases and a big staff meeting and loud talking takes place everytime.  IT IS CERTAINLY NOT RELAXING ANY LONGER.  The security guard for sanitizing stands right in front of the coffee place and shouts at everyone walking past on top of his voice.    And to crown it all, the croissant we had was to oily and greezy it was TERRIBLE.   The lady behind the counter referred us to the not sure supervisor / F&B manager to complain to.  She had the loudest voice among all the staff.  We told her our unhappiness and she didn't even comment on it so I doubt she will not do anything about it.    That was my last visit to this little coffee shop, I will rather walk a bit further to The Merchant Coffee shop.

Checkers,Eastern Cape Checkers  Division,Checkers Swd Region,Checkers Oudtshoorn,COMPLAINT,ADVERTISING,NO STOCK - EDIBLE & NON-EDIBLE GROCERIES,Checkers Responsive Web,Advertised specials never available,"Good day, my apology for sending a complaint, I really do not like to complain, I find it tasteless and a bother to complain when there are so many who has really big worries.

This branch, however, is really a problem. There is no customer care - ziltch - from management to staff, they are all absolutely clueless and horribly lazy. From keeping loos clean and having basic soap and toilet paper to no knowledge or even availability of stock specials.

All of the above is being experienced by customers of Checkers Oudtshoorn.  The excuse from management, this is a small town, we can't expect city service and stock availability. Nonsense.

My husband went to Checkers on the 2nd of January 2022, with a print screen of the Checkers Specials catalogue marked 03/01/2022 - 23/01/22 - page 7 (I still have it on my phone). Note. Checkers Specials catalogue....... clearly noted on top in black.

He wanted to buy the condensed milk special of 2 cans for R40 (he would have taken 4 or 6 since I use it in a lot of recipes), but he was advised by staff that the special is only at Checkers Hyper. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, my husband is not someone who starts arguments or disagreements, so he left the matter and left the store, albeit disappointed.

But I have been showing him the difference between Checkers catalogues and Hyper catalogues, also pointing out the date.

Today he agreed we should share our experiences with you, although we do not like complaining or arguing or making an issue, I really have had it with this branch and their bad service. I know the standard of Checkers/Hyper and the standard expected from their staff, I know the pride Head Office has for the brand and I know the standard of service at this store is shoddy and far below acceptable level of service and retail.

This type of excuse is an ongoing issue, which is why I made a printscreen of the catalogue - this has happened a few times before with us, and as I understand from friends, with others as well.

I complain about this branch, not the brand, and I hope that something will be done to deal with it. If this branch is not performing on your books, this is why. If they are, I can assure you that someone is not relaying the true experience to you.

Again, thank you for being an amazing brand. My sincerest apologies that I do not have something really nice and uplifting to share with you, but I am sure that you realize that we do care about the brand which has prompted us to contact you.

May you all have a blessed day.

Kind Regards

I would like to put in a complaint against a manager Clifton Julies, who works at the Checkers York street, George Branch.

On 13/01/2022 after 20h00(the shop was closed) he verbally abuse one of the female employees. He was using foul language on her in front of other employees and customers. This is unacceptable for a manager to do so. He knew there were people around him and he start performing as if he owned Checkers. He is an embarrassment to the company. It's the 3rd time, that I, the customer hear how he scolder his fellow employees, threatens them. Please see that he gets a warning, if not I will take this matter further on social media about his bad manners. They are too scared to take him on, I will. We all are humans, not animals. He has to understand that he works for a boss just like the casual employees, no need for him to think he's about them because of that casual workers who work hard for that embarrassment of a manager to get a salary every month. He needs to stop verbally abusing the workers, especially women.

I'm waiting for ur feedback

The merchandiser responded by saying he will notify the relevant merchandiser and suggested the customer to take a pic on the basis that the customer mentioned she will be paying the price as per the PI Label in case it gets removed.When the customer got to the till the cashier called the manager for authorization as she indicated to her that asper the PI Label the peanut butter is supposed to be R1.99. Mr. Mabaso came and said he is not going to sell peanut butter for R1.99 and mentioned he will have to do his investigation. Customer indicated to him that she needs to go and fetch her son when he is done investigating he can give him a call. The manager then asked the customer to follow him; they went to the peanut butter section. When they got there he asked the customer ï¿½in your right mind what makes you think the peanut butter can be R1.99ï¿½.  Customer questioned the statement and asked if the manager was saying he is crazy as it is not the manner to speak to customers and felt disrespected by the manager. The manager was causing a scene shouting of which customer mentioned to him, this is not his house and therefore he needs to conduct himself in a professional manner as he is representing Checkers.

I went to my local store and I was not 'helped' until the regional HR manager Cassara Moodley asked me to zoom in on the blurred provinces that the particular 'national' advert applied to. These were not clear and according to her excluded KZN.The lack of clarity in this regard has caused me to be unhappy with the way that shoprite hides the regional adverts under blurred small print and has inconvenienced myself and caused me to waste my time and petrol.Please look into this and adjust your fine print so that such instances are minimised in the future.SincerelyJames Purdon,1340950,#,#,22/01/2022,Completed,Julien Mafouta,James,Purdon,#,22/01/2022,Careline,99247

I have purchased on your special 4 blocks of Crystal Valley Butter last weekend.  
This batch (refer attached photo), has a funny taste and a lot of oil on the paper.  We have used this brick the same way we have used all the others before (intermittent storage outside of the fridge).  We have stopped using this brick.
The other bricks bought are not of the same batch; the new one opened is of acceptable quality and tastes like we are used to for this product.

This after I left several messages for a manager to call back.Quite a lot of issues are wrong at that store. Staff packing shelves, damaged boxes in your way, on the floor (today) dairy section, I even had to move it out the way. Staff are in groups chatting, you have to wait for them to finish conversations, especially at the tills, Empty shelves, nobody at the vegetable section to weigh and put a sticker on,  staff standing around chatting, no friendliness to customers, no greeting, conveyor area absolutely filthy, no wipe downs, they scream at you when asking if you want packets. They speak to friends and packers in their own language while you at the till, one even checking her nails, another adjusting her hair etc. No Covid rules there, no wiping, no spraying or sanitizing,  It is just  all round such a badly managed store. I frequent the one in Raslou, in Centurion where I live and everytime I come to Alberton, Brackendowns, I have to come to this one, as it is close to the house and  I do enjoy Checkers prices.  Seriously, you cannot communicate with management there, you can't speak to them on the phones, they don't answer for days, you get past  switchboard but they don't answer their phones in the office. Also, there is so much lack of discipline and customer care, it is quite shocking.  It would be better as an online store, as it seems that this is the way to go. Staff are mopping floors in the middle of the day and no care for customers trying to pass and hogging a whole aisle at a time. The vegetables especially tomatoes have ""insects"" flying around and the area is filthy, the stock is depleted. It has to be the worst Checkers I have ever been to and the levels have dropped to zero over the last year. You definately need a change of Management there. Suggestion of going undercover and experience what it is like to be a client. On these last occasions the store has been incredibly quite with very few customers. Sadly, there seems to be no care whatsoever for customers and staff really don't care.I trust you will look into this and would appreciate some feedback in this regard.Kind Regards,Mercia Corrigan--MerciaCorrigan2017@gmail.com    Cel no. 073 105 1014 / 066 219 3771Disclaimer:https://www.shopriteholdings.co.za/email-disclaimer.html",1320557,#,#,14/01/2022,Completed,Alize Feris,Mercia,Corrigan,+27 743105101,14/01/2022,Careline,2492

Could you rather use non-GMO maize flower, and of less concern use spice that is not irradiated instead (in future)

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Pta East Region,Checkers CX Castle Gate,COMPLAINT,POINT OF SALE,ELECTRONIC PAYMENT,Telephony,Overcharged,"Dear sir,I tried to lodge this complaint on your website. The page simply does not work! POOR!When this store (Castle Gate) first opened I was quite impressed and started frequenting it regularly. I had never before been a Checkers customer.  I liked the product selection and store layout.Soon after the opening a very close friend of mine stated ""he would never again go there""! He related a story to me that he was charged much more at the till than what had been advertised in the isles, and that it took him 45 minutes at the till to get it sorted and get his refund.This story stuck with me, but I kept going.Until this morning that is! Exactly the same happened to me. I popped in for some minor goodies I required and in the process bought two items which were advertised at the counter to be R55 if any 2 were selected. This is what I did.Remembering the story from my friend I did watch the price at the till, something I just never do, and true to form, the full undiscounted prices were rung up.I immediately queried the till slip and refused to pay. The cashier became annoyed and rude, but eventually - upon my insistence - called what I think was a supervisor. She then asked for the sign at the counter which was fetched and confirmed my story. By now I have been standing there for some 10 minutes.She tried rescanning etc etc and eventually started calling out for other staff. By then I had had enough and walked out.I proceeded to buy my goods at the local Pick and Pay which is what I shall be doing again from now onwards.This transaction may be small and trivial. I do spend on average R4 to R5000 per month on food and home-products. But this type of incorrect invoicing and behaviour is at best sloppy, unprofessional and simply wrong; at worst it is fraudulent. And this is the second such incident at this store since your opening in a very affluent area. It is criminal and whilst I could look the other way if this happened once, twice now is a trend and I will refuse to support you.You will simply never see me again in one of your stores, and yes - this story will be spread out by myself and my friend to the very many people we know!!!yoursChris Van der Sande+27 82 456 1390PS : this complaint screen on your web also does not work very well!",1341588,#,#,22/01/2022,Completed,Brandon Anthony,Chris,Van der Sande,+27 82 456 1390,22/01/2022,Careline,85313

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Jhb South / East Region,Checkers East Rand Retail,PRAISE,SERVICE,MANAGEMENT,Checkers Responsive Web,Praise for handling of complaint,"I bought a rolled pork belly roast on Sunday the 9th of January and while shopping found some crumbed chicken schnitzel with mould growing on them, which I removed from the shelf and brought it to a lady working in the butcheries attention. On opening the pork roast I had a nasty suprise, the product was off. The smell was definitely that of rotting meat (spoilage bacteria doing a good job!). I returned the product on Monday the 10th of January and received a refund (thank you). Following this a gentleman named Thabo contacted me and apologised profusely for the error. He then delivered a package to me today and gave me the assurance that the problem was being dealt with. I would like to say that I was very impressed with the way my complaint was handled especially by Thabo after a bit of a bumpy start. Thabo was very professional and eager to get the problem rectified. Please note that I do not complain in the hope of getting a reward, the reason why I complain is food safety should never be compromised, being a food safety specialist I understand the importance of a robust food safety system where errors can be identified and corrected. Things go wrong, I understand that, but what is important is what is going to be done to prevent a recurrence. 
Now onto my suggestions for improvement:
1. The 60sixty delivery staff should be wearing their masks correctly. At East Rand Retail they very rarely wear their masks while waiting for a delivery.
2. Do till Packers receive training on how to pack? I have on numerous occasions had to step in and help, I have cooler bags for perishables and when handing over my bags I always request for the perishables to be packed in the cooler bags to no avail. I always have to step in and help. I'd rather just pack my own groceries.
That's a very long story, but I hope that it is taken with the understanding that it comes from a good place, there is always place for improvement. I did say that I would never shop at Checkers East Rand Retail Park again, but may reconsider and I hope that of I do shop there again that I will see some (even small) improvement.

This took him most of the day to do as it is not easy.He then realised that he had too little clips from his last set, so he returned to store and went to speak to the Branch Manager. The branch manager told him that in order to assist, he would need to bring back the whole set, and then they will mark it as short and replace the covers with a new set. The customer advised but this is not a viable solution for him. Firstly, it was not his fault that the clips were short, and secondly it took him the whole day to put the covers on the seat, so for him to remove it and then put it back again is really inconvenient for something that was no fault of his own.He says that Justice was extremely unhelpful, insisted that he cannot do anything else to help and that he must come back with the seat covers. He brushed him off and went on with whatever else he was doing. He had no regard for customer service and made no attempt to help him. He sent the front end controller Tabitha to tell the customer again that they cannot help, and even she had an attitude.

I have recently come across your Puddi Cat Pilchard Flavour soft cat food, which appears to be retailing at approximately R15.00 per tin. 

I have noticed that your stores carry very limited stock, and I am currently in a position where I personally deal with multiple feral cats, and ordinarily require in excess of 15 trays per month. So far, I have seen a liking toward this particular flavour, and am wondering if it is at all possible to make arrangements to do a bulk order of 18 trays per month at a suitable price catered to bulk buying. 

I am amenable to mix the order between Pilchard flavour and Chicken & Liver flavour. 

My proposal is to do it on an 'as and when' basis, so as to limit your overheads of carrying too much stock, which will allow a lead time between notification of order and ordering. Lead time considering.

Kindly revert back to me with your consideration as soon as reasonably possible.",1372850,Puddi Cat,Cat food,30/01/2022,Completed,Keturah Rangasami,Gregory,Tarica,+27 826028020,30/01/2022,Careline,85371

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Jhb Central Region,Checkers Green Valley,COMPLAINT,PRODUCT,PERISHABLE,Checkers Responsive Web,Complaint about products,"We bought a sandwich from Checkers Green Valley on Saturday.  The sandwich was not toasted properly and had loads of melted butter on the outside which was cold and not very appetizing.  Not how a toasted sandwich should be prepared.  The lemon poppy seed muffin had a piece of someone's hair weave in which my husband swallowed and almost choked on.  He had to pull his mask down at the shop to retrieve the piece of hair weave that had got stuck in his throat.  Disgusting and totally unacceptable.  Then a 900g block of cheese that I bought two weeks ago, completely sealed and kept at the back of my fridge has started going off.  It only expires in March 2022 but already there is mould forming on the cheese.  I am not very happy with the quality that I am getting at Checkers.  The food is not fresh and prepared properly, no quality control.  Also I order through the Sixty60 app and there is also increasingly issues there too.  My food arrives and the seal has been opened.  This has happened to bread rolls, pies and sweets.  How is it possible to open the seal - my items are probably being thrown and manhandled if that is happening because in all the years that I have done my own shopping I have never had this issue.  I received a brown broccoli as well once.  Why would you pack a broccoli that is not fresh.  The service is not what it used to be.  I am very very disappointed.

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Far West Region,Checkers Horizon,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Checkers Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"On the 31st of December 2021 I was a the Checkers branch in Horizon Village to buy a few items including 2kg chicken portions. I went to the fridge where they are kept and there was a promotional price displayed there (which I ignored because I do not have the Checkers rewards card) and the was also the small one similar to those that are displayed on the shelves. I took a packet aligned with a price label of R56.99 and when I went to the till to pay I was told that I had taken the wrong packet because it had scanned R118.00 at the till, to which I then asked that I be given the right one. A lady that was packing groceries for the casher (Nomathemba Koti) left to fetch it and came back with a packet similar to the one I had taken. She confirmed that there price displayed there was R56.99 and that there was no packet of chicken portions in that fridge. After asking the cashier if I could not be given the item in the price I had seen it she called a guy that had no name tag. We went to the fridge but the small price tag was not there and when I told him what had happened he started arguing with me. He then left to look for the manager, who was out of the shop at the time (I think I had to wait for him about 5 minutes). He came back and attended to me but he was of no help as well because he could not answer if I had to pay for the item at the price I had seen it for and he did not confirm my story with the lady that had gone there to check the right product for me. Even though I had said that I was in a hurry he wanted to argue with me  and I feel insulted as a customer because I feel like I am being treated like a crook. As a resident of Roodepoort West and an individual that works at Horizon village it is now uncomfortable going in the store as I feel like everyone watches me and talk about me behind my back (even though I had been in the store for about 3 times since the incident).

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Jhb North Region,Checkers Kyalami,COMPLAINT,STORE,ENVIRONMENT,Checkers Responsive Web,Store complaint,"Good day, this is the second time I am having to complain about Checkers Kyalami Corner. I visited the store today at 9:30 am. At that time, it was chaos. My complaints:
1. The Sixty 60 shoppers all over the aisles, blocking access with their trolleys.

2. The aisles being cleaned at 9:44 am even though the store opens at 8 am. You are trying to shop navigating through other customers, cleaners, packers and 60-60 shoppers. Should the cleaning and packing not be done BEFORE the store opens?

3. Packers standing with shoes on the shelves packing. Is this not a health issue. How disrespectful to stand with filthy shoes where we buy our food. Who knows what goes on behind the scenes? Further, should staff not be provided with step ladders to reach high points in order to pack shelves. 

4. I could not get access to the foil/paper towels because it was blocked by crates of bread. Again shelves are being packed at around 10 am.

5. Only 3 cashiers at a busy period in the morning and 1 express cashier operating till points. Again, this makes social distancing impossible and creates long queues,

5. The behaviour of the tellers who are selective about which customers get treated properly. There is no greeting, please or thank you and I had to even pack my own groceries on my last visit because the cashier just sat at the till and ignored me. 

Itï¿½s disappointing that I have had to highlight these issues before and the manager has done nothing to rectify the situation.

Unfortunately I will now be forwarding this complaint to the health authorities because social distancing -in light of the pandemic-is not being enforced. Further standing on the shelves and filthy isles where foodstuff is packed is not acceptable and needs to be investigated.",1303596,#,#,08/01/2022,Completed,Nadeem Salie,Nisha,Moodley,829942730,08/01/2022,Careline,58150

In the last few weeks the quality of the product has deteriorated and many of the bottles are nearly flat and have very little fizz when opened. The problem seems to be that the caps are being made with a ring attached that ensures the bottle has not been opened. The new caps do not separate easily from the ring and that ring seems to prevent proper closing and pressurizing of even newly filled bottles.
There are also differences in the level to which the bottles are being filled and several times bottles have been overfilled.

I have already contacted Hinds to relay my complaint and this is what I sent:
I purchased from Checkers online store 2 x boxes of dried parsley.  I usually buy another brand but I saw yours was on special so chose these instead.  I use the dried parsley for tea and have always just tasted pure parsley.  Unfortunately, your brand did not taste like parsley and rather a combination of celery and who knows what else.  I cannot stand the taste of celery and therefore unable to drink a further cup. I am very involved with implementing food fraud mitigation measures in place and realise that herbs are one of the most targeted items in the food industry at the moment.  Please could you sort this out? Batch numbers: B/B 05/07/2023 RP, MNF 05/01/2022 13:22. I am also contacting Checkers for them to ensure measures are implemented.

Customer says he did not open or touch the fridge, he was just passing when this happened. This incident happened around 12:53 PMA manager was called to come assist the customer. The manager apologised and offered to get him a rub to put on the leg for the pain. The customer refused as how can this be offered without knowing what the damage to the leg was. The customer thinks this is not how it should have been handled as he is an Occupational Health and Safety rep, and knows policies. I apologised to the customer and reassured him that the manager only had good intentions by making this offer. I apologised for the experience as a whole and assured customer we will follow the correct procedures.

Im a fan of your Sixty60 initiative as it creates more job opportunities and include more people into the job market. 

I do just want to bring this to your attention. In order for them to reach the target of delivering their order in 60 minutes Ive had the experience multiples times now that some of the buyers forget the customer in store. 

I have left it in the pass as I know they have to reach their target of 60 minutes but today was just one to many. Not only did an individual leave his trolley in such a way that no one can pass while he was shopping  but also had a female that pushed me out of the way to get pass me quicker. When I approached her and said she must think about the customers in store she just gave me this unpleasant look. Just to find the same lady 2 minutes later leaving her trolley at a space that no one can pass and another customer had to take the trolley out of the way. I again approached her and ask her to think about other people as she does whatever she wants to do get her shopping done. Also had another gentleman that just pushed his way into an ideal when I was making way for a young girl pushing a trolley to pass.

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Jhb South Region,Checkers Riverwalk,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CASHIER,Checkers Responsive Web,Complaint: Arrogant Cashier and Manager,"Greetings,

I am utterly disgusted at the customer service level received under numerous visits to this particular store. I visited this store yesterday to purchase some items and was in the queue waiting to pay, the lady customer before me at the till was short of money,  the cashier and her had a chat and the customer left to fetch money from outside the store  whilst holding up the queue for 20 to 25 minutes, the cashier did not communicate, only after me asking politely is this going to take long, she replies rude and arrogantly Yes. I felt very unwanted and unwelcoming as if buy if you want or get lost. I immediately asked for a manager to resolve the wait of me and other customers. Only to be told by the cashier, there is no branch manager available, only stand in manager is a lady called Emily, to my surprise she herself could not come up with a suitable answer as to why the delay with cashier and this very customer. The mere fact that no apology  was presented to me by the manager and cashier shows that we don't care about customer service, the customer is always right policy can kiss my buttocks.

As a sole owner of a Volkswagen franchise in Gauteng South of Jhb, I don't teach my staff of 192 people this kind of behavior and service levels. You have to be a great leader so your footsteps will be paved in the future. 

I will tell family, friends, my staff never to shop or support the Checkers as they need us to keep the doors open not the other way around.

Disgruntled customer.

I have always bought fish at checkers and must say that I have always been very happy. I bought fish at tour store yesterday and had a really bad smell to it when I removed it from the packaging. I went ahead and fried it as I thought it was maybe just some strong smelling hake. 
It even stank more and tasted rotten.
I feel you need to relook at the cold chain in this specific store.
The fish is in the bin and I did not keep my slip

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Pta South East Region,Checkers Silver Lakes,ENQUIRY,CORPORATE,DONATIONS,Checkers Responsive Web,Tiqwa School Donations,"Dear Checkers Team,

At Tiqwa School, we seek to help special needs learners by creating an environment where they can learn to lead independent lives and better function in society.

While we have made some great strides, Tiqwa still has a lot to accomplish. 

Due to the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of learners at Tiqwa declined drastically over the past two years. Consequently, it is difficult to make ends meet every month, especially considering that we receive no government subsidy even though Tiqwa is registered with the Gauteng Department of Education. Nevertheless, we still make it our first priority to give each learner the hope of becoming a literate and independent person.

We need your support with the following: 
- Supplies for our cooking classes
- Cleaning products to keep our school clean and COVID-free, especially since our learners are high risk
- Stationary to enable our learners to do schoolwork

Would you consider donating goods or a voucher to help us achieve our mission?

If you have any questions, I would be happy to provide you with more information about how you can help support our work at Tiqwa School.

Please find attached to this email our Tiqwa Brochure for more information about our school and what our aspirations are with these special and precious learners.

We greatly appreciate your donation, and it will be used to realise our mission of ensuring that these learners make meaningful contributions to society, regardless of their limitations. 

Please join us! With your donation, weï¿½re one step closer to making a difference in the lives of our special learners!

Sincerely,
Christa van Tonder

Checkers,Gauteng Checkers Division,Checkers Jhb North Region,Checkers Sunninghill,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CASHIER,Checkers Responsive Web,Poor customer service experience,"Good day 

I went to Checkers in Sunninghill earlier, the cashier who assisted was very rude with no customer service skills at all. Firstly I greeted she never responded. I purchased my goods and asked her to give me cash back of R100 she advised me that she just started her shift now and she doesn't have, with an attitude. After standing there for a good minute or two while she is calling around I over heard her asking her collogues for R400 so I advised her that I asked for R100 not R400, I could see the look she gave me was not nice she moved the card machine with attitude, sanitize her hands in a rude way with attitude that the spray went into my face.

I am a customer service consultant for the past 20 years and never ever have I experience such attitude from any Checkers staff at all I think it's Horrible and that your employees should not be employed if they don't know how to deal with customers. She never had a name tag like other employees I saw on the receipt her name is Xolisile Ndingi, she looked either tired with an attitude that stinks as if she does not want to be there at work.

Me as a customer doesn't have to know about the fact that she just started her shift and also if she doesn't have an amount in her cahier she should make it her mission to see that she gets that amount without telling me the customer that she doesn't have.

I just thought that I should bring this to your attention as I think it the service I received was very bad.

I greeted first then after Melicent scanned the groceries I then said to her Yes thank you I would take packets since she did not bother to ask, I asked for R50 Now this is when it went ALL THE WAY SOUTH FOR ME. Her answer was a simple NO she canï¿½t she does not have cash just coins. I said again I want to draw R50 then she proceeded to tell me she has only had 1 customer I cannot expect her to have cash. I asked for the manager she ignored the request I asked again and she said manager canï¿½t do anything for me if there is no cash in store. So I explained to her they have hugely written Money Market and she told me just because it says that does not mean they always have money. 
So I told her any shop that trades needs to have a certain amount for an early morning float. Now this is where I realised she had no idea what I was saying. I never got to see a manager but this VERY VERY INTELLIGENT cashier Found R50. After all that pure nonsense. I only want ONE QUESTION ANSWERED. Where are checkers cashiers trained. Never do I walk into a superstar or a Woolworths and get such utter vulgar rude service. Never. This is the only answer I seek so I can understand why every time I go into checkers I watch the only customer Melicent had before me was an African lady and she got a hullo she was asked if she needs packets and was treated like an African Queen. So either this cashier canï¿½t stand white people or I have offended her in her past life. I am slowly getting tired of walking into sunward checkers and being treated so horrible. Just put boards up by the cashiers who hate serving white people. Easy. 
Melicent was cashier 8. 
This cashier needs so much training that a year wonï¿½t be enough. She has zero idea on how business works and even less service. I will however say that I am SO GRATEFUL Melicent is not a manageress and I doubt stands a chance for a promotion because that will be a train smash. Thatï¿½s the only positive I experienced today. So if checkers provides these services and cannot deliver then donï¿½t open the doors, but if checkers is offering the service but cannot accommodate early in the morning then put signs up and advertise only from a certain time withdrawals are available. 
And thatï¿½s how a situation I had the unfortunate pleasure of being involved in is prevented. 
I really hope this issue gets sorted. I am tired of shopping at this checkers and doing the job of all the managers and I donï¿½t get paid for it. 
Please, no apologyï¿½s just explaining no apology can fix this mistake.

Why do you render a service that you can not provide, Your staff need to be appreciative for the jobs that they have, Its us as customers that keep your business doors open, we do not need to hear their negative remarks. A simple solution or my suggestion is for deli department to ask for help when they do get too much work.

Staff compliant
Lately I have been shopping at Checkers Wilrogate Roodepoort instead of my Family Pick n' Pay Wilro Park as I have found Checkers has a larger selection of groceries. On Friday the 14th January 2022  time 10;43am I went to lanel 7 where I waited as I was the next customer to go through this lane. There was no Till Closed sign put on the counter to say till 7 was closed. After waiting about 10 minutes the cashiers in a rude manner told me to go to another cashier. I told her that I have been waiting some time to use this till and that I was not going to go wait at another cashiers till as the queues where long. Once the customer finished paying for her goods I waited for teller 7 namely Sinovuyo Gomana to attend to my purchase. Before putting my items on the counter top I asked the cashier to please wipe the counter as it was very dirty from the previous . She looked at me and as if to say why do I have to wipe the counter and then carried speaking to the packer then after a while she started wiping the counter. I greeted the cashier by saying Good morning and she did not greet me back. On this note this is not the first time since going to Checkers Wilrogate I have found staff and management unfriendly compared to Pick n' Pay where staff and management would ask how are you before you even start shopping. Some items on Checkers shelves are out of stock for weeks and when asking management when it will come in you get told with a not interested attitude dont know. Checkers need to have a supervisor standing on the front line by the tills to see the attitude of the staff as this is not the first time this has happened to me. I am a 76 year old lady and I feel respect costs nothing and to be polite as well.
Thank you.

Yesterday (16Janï¿½22) I bought some chicken (see screen shots) from Checkers Preller, only to discover that it was not fresh as per the label.
The date of ï¿½Sellï¿½ & ï¿½Useï¿½ was stipulated as 15 Janï¿½22 ï¿½ which I only discovered upon opening the chicken and itï¿½s feel and smell.
I thought that it could be still okay, with just a day old ï¿½ not sure if this was perhaps a re-issue of the label given the same date for ï¿½Sellï¿½ & ï¿½Useï¿½.

Upon roasting it in the oven, the smell did not diminish; on the contrary after it was roasted, I had a taste and informed the family not to eat of it for fear of any illness that could be initiated.

Checkers,N-Cape Division Checkers,Northern Cape Checkers Region,Checkers Kalahari Mall,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,TROLLEYS AND BASKETS,Checkers Responsive Web,Poor Customer Experience,"Hello, I was going to shop at Checkers but my 7 year old boy needed to get a hair cut at the barber shop inside the mall. Thus, also having a 2 year old, I went into the store to grab a cart, since the carts outside were hot after seating under the sun the whole morning, and it would burn my toddler if I used it. I was immediately informed that I couldn't get the cart out of the store and that instead I needed to get one from the parking lot, which trust me, it was my first intention since my toddler is on the tallest and heaviest side of his percentil group. This happened at approximately 13:00 h and the mall is called Kalahari Mall for a reason. It gets extremely hot during summer. 

Now, I understand the reason for the rule, but not all weather types in South Africa are the same, and besides, I don't think it is sound advise to tell a customer that he/she needs to go grab a cart that has been under the Kalahari desert's sun the whole morning and part of the afternoon, so that his/her 2 year old gets burned while trying to some shopping. Especially, when there was no shortage of cars inside the store, and like I said, I had a toddler to sit on the car so that I could actually do some shopping.

Thus, I would appreciate if you could takie extreme weather situations and chlidren into consideration when enforcing some of these rules. If I have to go to Spar, or Game, or Woolworths to get a shoppong car, chances are I am getting my shopping done there, since Checkers happens to be at the opposite end of the Mall.

I typically do not check the sell by date of every item that I purchase, and assume Checkers has a QA process in place to ensure fresh products past their sell by dates are not presented on the shelves for customers to purchase.

I still have the chicken, and will not eat it.I am an Engineer and am familiar with QA processes and food safety. I know under the FCD Act, it is a criminal offence to sell expired food. I have two young children, who have higher health risks associated with eating expired food.

Today I went to Checkers Seadoone and pick up two packets of pre-cut fries / potatoes chips after seeing that they are 2 for R45 but upon reaching the till they scan R60 each, the lady accompanied me to show her where I saw this tag and she saw it and took it to the till. Now the problem comes when the customer is supposed to pay what I saw. Debbie keeps insisting the price I saw was for the item prevoiusly packed there and it's not even chips, it's vegetables so they can't give me the at the price I saw it at, I disagree, it's not my fault that they didn't do housekeeping, why would they stock an item and not put the correct price. I was even more offended when Santosh Kisten came and said I should have read the label... Now how can I read the small printing in a label that is inside a fridge, the only thing visible was the 2 for R45. They even went on to say if it was the same item they would do it at below that price tag they would do it for me at that price but since it's two different items they can't ?? which is hogwash. They had two whole lines of chips below that orange tag special. You basically every time I go to the Stï¿½r I have to correspond the price put on an item because on top of spending my money there I have also turned into their merchandiser.

I would like to bring to your attention a serious issue faced in recent times.

Last week i was shopping and the place was busy, i had these same agents moving our trolleys out the way whilst we picking stuff off the shelf which is very wrong, during covid times i do not want someone else touching my stuff. 
Further to that they asked an old lady to please move out their way because they were in a hurry and she was in their way.

I hope you are well. I am coming to you first, as a retailer concerning my very frustrated complaint. I have purchased 2 marinated pork packs from Checkers Hyper Cornubia Mall and on both occasions, I have opened them to a stench and then proceeded to cook them in hope of it getting better, only for it to be tasted and leave me feeling nauseated and disgusted because it was off and spoilt. Once could be a mistake. On 2 occasions this is a pattern. I decided not to go public as yet, you guys have a chance to rectify this and refund me for my purchases of which I do not have slips or record of due to this being purchased and frozen.

Checkers,Natal Checkers Division,Ch Durban Central Region,Checkers Cornubia,COMPLAINT,PRODUCT,PERISHABLE,Checkers Responsive Web,ORANGE GROVE FRESH CREAM - SPOILT,"This is not something new at this store and whilst I find that they solve the issue out in most instances, the continuous inconvenience to clients is unacceptable.  It costs more to make a trip to return a defective product and then when you get instore one needs to wait a considerable amount of time before everything is resolved.  Further when calling the store to complain, they answer after 10 rings and put you on hold and forget all about you.
That is not conducive to good service.

The 1litre Orange Grove fresh Cream was bought yesterday 30.01.2022 and found to be sour by this morning. This is not the first time - there is obviously issues at the store.  My colleague had a similar problem and was told that the cold chain was broken and there was nothing they can do.  I will not accept such an excuse.  Your company are the specialists in this field - so please find the problem and rectify it.  As a client i am paying the asking price for good, fresh quality product.  I should not receive anything less and i must be compensated for any additional costs I have to incur just to sort these issues - especially as it is recurring.
I have left my details and expect feedback at your soonest.
Thank you
Kind regards

I purchased the pot o gold frozen sweetcorn from checkers in cornubia,  a few weeks ago.

I opened the sweetcorn packet yesterday and it had a revolting smell. I first though it was probably some brine smell. I rinsed the sweetcorn but the chemical like smell didn't go away. 
The sweetcorn seemed to have been soaked  in some kind of chemical before freezing. 

I still can't get over the smell. What kind of chemicals are you guys using food.

A young lady(Natalie) was unable to replace the three packets because of Checkers policy of needing to have cash slips. I explained that these had long been disposed of so she called her immediate senior Front Shop Manager, one Warren (Suda..something?)
This is where it rapidly went downhill with Warren then responding to an angry outburst on my part when I tossed the biscuit packet on to the front shop desk. He became very aggressive and loudly threatened to call in store security and view the CCTV footage  - this all happening in full view of other Checkers staff and customers in close proximity! 
I found Warren's response to my assertions totally uncalled for and certainly not in keeping with the Checker's claim to customer satisfaction.
Must my wife and I now shift our loyalties to Pick 'n Pay, Spar and Woolworths? Just say so and we will be history and very vocal in social media.

So she n I went to check on the shelf and it was still there. Then I left her there going back to the till, then she called a guy in an orange t-shirt.
After 2minutes or so she went pass the till said she needs a manager to do it. I waited for 2 more minutes.
Then Deon Moonsamy come and 
said he won't give it to me with the price I saw because it was not the right price told me I need to go with him to check, when we got there they had packed the shelves differently so he said someone had put it there.
When I asked him why they made me wait so long he told me he also waits by my work place (I work in 1 of the shops around the mall?)  which I don't understand what that had to do with me being a customer at checkers but it made it clear to me that he wasn't giving it to me because I work at the mall. He asked me why I didn't take a picture of it. I mean who goes around taking pictures when shopping n I had gone to check it with the supervisor she saw what I saw. I asked him to call her and ask her he refused, I asked him to check on their cameras he said I'm not allowed to.  Turned around accused me of shouting at him and told he he had a right to kick me out of his shop.
I really didn't appreciate how he spoke to me  as if I'm one of his stuff members that his always shouting around the whole shop special the merchandisers.  I felt so disrespected by  Deon Moonsamy, what upset me the most is that they could have explained to me the difference between the item I had and the label it was under  but no they decided to play me for a fool, and worst my time more then 30 minutes.

Dear Sir/Madam,

We used to be regular Pick and Pay customers until their public address system turned up so loud that one could not concentrate on shopping. Complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears so we changed to shopping at Checkers Watercrest. We were extremely pleased with our decision as our shopping experiences have been delightful. Until today! 
All of a sudden we might as well have been back at Pick and Pay as the announcements, music, and adverts  were so loud. One could not hear oneself think and making an informed decision became impossible. We complained in store but there was no response.
We have been shopping at Checkers for three years now and would hate to resort to shopping at Spar. Therefore we hope for a return to an atmosphere where the voice of reason prevails.

Sincerely.

Mrs. M. C. Duffy

The granny then wanted to take video footage in which the woman claims the other male customer grabbed the phone from her hand and said no footage will be taken, this left the granny and her daughter and son traumatized.The customer claims that there were other customers watching them and staff members but no one came to help calm the situation, when they were trying to locate a manager in the heat of the moment there was no manager visible at one point and not one security in sight to diffuse the matter.After the heated argument the management arrived to the scene in the store and requested the customers (mother, granny and son) to please come to the managerï¿½s office to further discuss and address.The son and his grandmother were hysterical and trembling and was offered water by the regional.The other two males was then called to the office to apologize but her son chased them away as another heated argument came upon themThe customer says the other male customer then left the store and no details was captured of them, the police was not called.The customer then advised the manager was the regional Mumsy, advised that the Regional did not address this serious matter accordingly and they did not feel safe as the argument was very intense and the other male customers could have taken out a firearm or any weapon if they had one and it could have escalated with no staff member assisting in trying to calm it down, the customer says she feels very unsafe in the Checkers environment also mentioned that no one walked them to their car as they could have been attacked and will never shop at the store again, also mentions they are leaving the country in a weeks time and did not want to have anything against their name.The customer feels that this is racism and discrimation as they were two women (The customer mentions that the other male customer thought there were White in race however when they opened their mouth they noticed that they were not) The customer says that a security member was talking to the male customers in Zulu, which they felt was very discrimating and insulted.The customer says that she will be consulting her lawyers on Monday and shall also take this to the Media and shame the Checkers brand in not assisting in this situation, advised that management should know how to handle these types of matters which seemingly they donï¿½t and would like to bring this to the attention of the head office and requires feedback.",1367857,#,#,29/01/2022,Completed,Shandre Permall,Jordan,Robinson,822660020,29/01/2022,Careline,2175

Trust you are well.  Just want to complement you on the stunning look for the new checkers!  I just need to bring to your attention that there is a big problem by the Deli department.  Every time I visit the shop to buy cold meat, there is only 1 person in this square are.  It is impossible for that person working in the Deli to see who to serve first.  I went to the shop on Sunday.(9 Jan) Stand in the line to get some cold meat.  Before me was 2 ladies. After she helped the 2 ladies, she turned around and went to the other side by the salads...I was there before the other customer but she help the customer first.  Then when I asked for Samwich ham, she only had a little bit left 13.00 o'clock in the day and then she told me she can not cut more..... Not sure why not....  Please see this as a question ask and not to get the lady in trouble.  I just think they need to look into this, a specially on weekends when it is extra busy.  The man that worked there once had to run up and down all around the square. Hope to get feedback on this.

At the entrance was a big advertisement showing the special. It was about supper time and I thought this deal would be perfect. I ordered the deal but to my disappointment and after a few attempts by the lady at the food counter running to and fro to the manager, we were told that the special had ended on the 3rd January (the ad clearly states that the special runs until the 16th, I only noticed this when I arrived at home). A few other customers including myself walked away rather sad missing out on the deal. My gripe with Cape Gate Checkers is why on earth would they advertise the deal on a massive board right by the entrance, this is not fair to customers. I still bought a whole chicken for supper as I was famished. To top it off, the cashier at the till told me...'sir did you know if you buy a whole chicken you can get a free cooldrink.' I just smiled and told her that the special is finished.This incident will by no means stop me from shopping at Checkers in the future, however, I do feel I was done an injustice today with false advertising.Advertisement and Till slip attached.

The store personnel are unable to provide any information and merely indicate that it is time to receive winter stock now (heaters etc). In the WC we are yet to enter the peak of summer.

Checkers,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Winelands Region,Checkers FX Constantia,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Checkers Responsive Web,Honey on tap,"Yesterday (Monday 17 January) I took an empty honey jar with me to Checkers at the Constantia Emporium and decanted honey into it from one of the two containers provided. Next to the honey dispenser were empty jars, marked at R8.00. Prices were also indicated for various amounts of honey, ranging up to 1 kg. The signage indicated something to the effect that the total price would be calculated by the teller. When I presented the jar of honey to the teller, with the rest of my shopping, and explained that I had decanted the honey into my own jar, she summoned a senior staff member, who sent for an empty jar, which the teller scanned. I saw afterwards on the till slip (attached) that I had been charged for an empty jar (which I had not purchased) but NOT charged for the honey itself. The initial puzzlement of the staff members involved and the subsequent error suggest to me that they were completely unaware of the process required to charge for the honey. 

While I don't object to getting a free jar of honey, I am concerned and disappointed that teller staff (including a supervisor) could bungle a procedure that must have been operating at this branch for some time. (I first saw the honey dispenser a week ago, 10 January, so honey has been available in this form for at least that long.) Also, I sincerely hope that customers are not obliged to purchase your jars, because that would defeat the ecological and economic purpose of selling honey this way.

Checkers,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Winelands Region,Checkers FX Constantia,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Checkers Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"Dear Checkers online staff 
Just for the record I was astounded at the poor level of customer service I received at Checkers Constantia (New shopping centre) when I attempted to return 2 packets of Sunlight washing powder that had incorrectly been substituted for my request for BIOCLASSIC on Checkers 60 online . This product was chosen so as to be used for grey water. SUNLIGHT washing powder is NO substitute!!!!  
When approaching customer service explaining my need for exchange at about 2pm on Monday 17 January the 2 staff were totally disinterested , reluctant to touch my clean checkers 60 bag, and said they would and could do nothing without a printed slip . 
The Sunlight washing powder was clearly in perfect condition and untouched. I proceeded to spend over R2000 on my monthly shop and on finishing again requested a manager to help me. It was now 3pm .
None materialized!! Eventually after an unpleasant interchange, wherein the staff member at customer services ran away from being photographed, R78 was credited to my purchase and I left Checkers thoroughly disconcerted by the unpleasant shopping experience I had . Please let me know what you intend doing to improve customer relations?.  At this point I think I will remain at Woolworths where I am always treated with respect and a willing ear. Thanks Jeanine

He especially drovefrom the Woolworths in Constantia Village to the Checkers Emporium as he likes the peri-peri roast chicken(ready-to-eat from the hot counter). Nonetheless, when we left (to my parentsï¿½ home) immediately after buyingthe chicken, I informed him that the chicken smell seems unusual. I was put off by it even before he opened thebag. When he opened the bag, I was not convinced that peri peri spice (plus whatever other spices they use)should smell that way. I was sure the chicken was off. I said that I was not eating what smelt unappetising,although I had already eaten a tiny piece ï¿½ then opted to throw the rest away. My brother reluctantly convincedhimself itï¿½s the spice combination, and since he bought from Checkers before and was always happy with thechicken, he believed all will be well ï¿½ against his better judgement; moreso because he was hungry.Gavin (my brother) and both my parents ate from it. My mom also said she thought itï¿½s not a good tasting chicken.Around 4am this morning, my mom was very ill. She had stomach pain, diarrhoea and fever. Around the sametime, both my dad and brother had upset stomachs too. My mom felt the worse as she had more severesymptoms.Thankfully they are all OK now. I presented with milder symptoms a few hours later because I had eaten thesmallest piece. I donï¿½t live there so this is the only food item we all had shared (although in different quantities).I realise that you will question about whether it was the chicken as technically there is no proof. I know it wasthe chicken. The smell was odd, and will choose to never buy chicken at Checkers again.Further, that my family all presented with similar symptoms at around the same time alluded to the incubationtime of the bacteria from the time they all ate together to onset of symptoms. I am a food microbiologist withexpertise in food-borne pathogens and its association with clinical disease. The reason for my email is forawareness only. Yes, it may be an isolated incidence but surely there must be quality control from the time rawchicken (within expiry) is roasted, to the monitoring of temperature and conditions for ensuring quality andsafety during storage. I let you know so that no one else has to experience the same and to ensure that otherready-to-eat chickens are of good quality and safety.Regards,Dr Diane Rip",1360231,Deli,Peri-peri chicken,27/01/2022,Completed,Alize Feris,Diane,Rip,+27 767853365,27/01/2022,Careline,83531

My wife required it for a recipe which required 500ml custard. After pouring the contents into a measuring jug it became evident that the indicated volume on your container measured out to be a just a touch over 350ml.I subsequently rinsed out the container and had to fill it with water to the point of overflowing in order to measure 500ml of liquid.Although I can understand that in all likelihood your production process does not allow you to fill containers to the brim, I must hasten to add that as a consumer I purchased 500ml of custard and NOT a 500ml container. The fact that the container is unable to accomodate what you say it does should not be the consumerï¿½s problem.To simply short change your consumers with 30 percent less than what your label claims is nothing less than disingenuous. A 150ml discrepancy in content is unacceptable. If youï¿½re selling 350ml of custard then it should state exactly that on your label.I have no desire to pursue the matter further in this instance, however I suggest that you own up to the fact that your company is misleading the public and make use of the opportunity to correct the matter.To Checkers, I trust that you will address the matter accordingly and revert.Yours SincerelyClyde Marais | 071 030 2273Paarl",1300830,The Menu,500ml Vanilla Flavoured custard,07/01/2022,Completed,Keturah Rangasami,Clyde,Marais,071 030 2273,07/01/2022,Careline,87836

My partner had to call the cleaner and ask her to call someone to assist, this girl comes scolding, irritated  that she has to assist, she assist the guest infront of us and then calls to us do we need help.I asked her for two double hot chocolate she says to me i have to make double and gets irritated, i told her there is two options on the board, single for R20 and double for R25, i told her its not necessary to be rude. She says to me that she is not rude and that she told me that it is double. Im a store manager and instead of getting defensive she should of apologized and make me understand where she is coming from.I went to the managers office there was no one, a lady which im guessing is manager walks pass, i said to her excuse me is there someone i could speak to she gives me the finger and says to me that i should wait she is busy with the customers thats with her i said its ok. She then came back to me and asked how she could assist me, i requested a email for head office complaints department she said she doesnt know it. She called a colleague from another store he told her that she should inform me regarding the TOLL free number on my loyalty card. I contacted the number and asked for the email. I explained to her that the cashier at the kiosk is disrespectful. The cashier name is Genevieve. When giving our order she only gave one double hot chocolate i then asked her where the other one is she said do i want another one. I then told her that this is what i was trying to explain to her in the beginning.I would like this matter to be dealt with.This is unacceptable. They are ambassador for the company, being disrespectful puts a bad name against checkers.People will not be saying the cashier was disrespectful but instead the cashier at CHECKERS was disrespectful.This affects businesses and it will travel by mouth.",1280452,#,#,01/01/2022,Completed,Shandre Permall,Labeeqah,Williams,#,01/01/2022,Careline,83549

Friday 28 January I had to buy a few things including airtime and data for my dad. There was a girl helping us and then all of a sudden a guy took over. When it came to buying airtime and data, my wife said that he looked like he didn't know what he was doing.

When we got home we just couldn't manage to load the airtime or the data, so my dad went to mtn to get help, and it turned out that the guy who helped us put the airtime on as Vodacom and not MTN.

I would not make a mistake of asking for Vodacom as I am not a Vodacom subscriber, Cell C perhaps since that is my network, but he gave us Vodacom and not MTN.

I am really disappointed since we wasted almost R100 to buy him airtime, so I would like to request that you actually train your cashiers and other employees to actually work fast and not get these things wrong.

While I was standing by the exit of Checkers thinking what must I do now, my phone rang. The lady said she's calling from Tymebank. I was a bit annoyed thinking I don't need sales calls right now. But she was really calling to inform me that my bank cards was handed in to Security at Checkers Kenilworth. She said I must either go to the Cash office there or ask for Qiyam. I was ecstatic. ?? I rushed to the customer service counter and asked for this Qiyam and said I'm coming to claim my bank cards. In no time the manager called him and while I waited for him a security lady came over to me. She asked me if I was coming to claim my lost bank cards. I said yes. She asked me to confirm how many cards was in my card holder. I named them. She smiled and said yes they do have it, a customer handed it in to them.

The prices below the items near the checkout often do not match the item above it. Yesterday I purchased a kuaii protein bar thinking it was the protein bar labelled Power bar at R10 thinking it's an introductory price or something of the sort. When I got home I noticed it was over R40. Today I took what I thought was the R10 protein bar, it was an entire row of only one kind of protein bar labelled at around R10 and it didn't look as fancy as the kuaii one. When I got home I noticed it was over 40 bucks again! I'm sure it's a good product but I just can't afford to pay that much for a bar and go by the price tags below the items.

I told her she is starting to upset me as I want to deposit and not withdraw, that is where she started to shout at me, turned the computer screen to my face and kept on shouting.

Checkers,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Northern Region,Checkers Paarl North,ENQUIRY,PRODUCT,EDIBLE AND NON-EDIBLE GROCERIES,Checkers Feature Phone,Enquiry: Old Spice Stick Deodorant,"Hi, 

I like doing my toiletry shopping at any Checkers in Paarl, but certain items you do not seem to sell. Why is this the case? For instance, the various options for Old Spice stick deodorant for men is never available in any store nor on the 60/60 app. You do have certain old spice products, but very limited. I always have to pop in at Clicks or Dis-chem as well just to get 1 product. 

The reason for the Old spice stick is that it does what it's supposedï¿½ to. During showers it washes off from the skin much easier then other stick deodorants and unlike other stick deodorants it does not cling to and stain shirts and t-shirts. 

Please consider selling all the Old spice stick deodorant options.

Checkers,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Atlantic Region,Checkers Table View,COMPLAINT,FINANCIAL SERVICES,CASHBACK,Consumer Email – Shoprite,Bad experience at Checkers in Bayside Mall (Procedure that i,"Good dayI would like to complain about the service I received at Checkers in Bayside Mall, firstly I stood in the line close to 20 minutes at the money market where as there was literally no line in front of me but people at the counter, there was no sense of urgency, secondly when I arrive at the money market counter asking for a cash back of R2000 and explaining that I will be transferring the same amount of R2010 using their services (which means I don't need the money in the hand) I was told that cash backs are not done at the money market which I did not understand why reason being I have used these services for years in the other different branches and I have never gotten this kind of issue not being allowed to do cash back at the money market it was the first at this branch, and then I asked for the manger to me called for me to explain why? Because this doesn't make sense and I so it Everytime in the other different branches and I have never had any issues or was never told about this, the Admin manager by the name of Thabile came after a few minutes which I assume they first discussed the matter before coming to me and she already had made her decision that she will stick to what they saying, without even considering to try and make the customer happy (even if it's a procedure put, help the customer and educate the customer about the procedure) but instead to chose to continue and tell me that she is not allowed even though I explained that I have done it multiple times in other branches and she couldn't explain why she was unable to do as I had requested the answer was just "" it's procedure"" I should ask the head office why, I asked for the customer complaint email and phone number so that I could raise my concerns about this, she chose to give me the email address of the store instead of the customer complaint line ( which I found very much disrespectful and underestimating my intelligence and looking at me as Stupid) hence that is why I have included the store email in this complaint to also show her Thabile(Admin manager) that I'm not stupid she should never again do what she did, when a customer asks for a complaint platform she should issue the customer as she had requested because when a customer complaints it actually gives you the opportunity to fix your wrongs, but when they keep quiet even if they not happy, they will walk away and not come back which means loss of business, I never thought I would have to explain that to a manager which I expected to know better then her cashiers, the same when procedures do not allow you to do something you should make the customer happy by doing it if it does not impact the business negatively then educate the customer for next time ( some customer service education for Thabile for next time).Otherwise I am deeply disappointed by the service I received in this branch today and deeply deeply disappointed in the way the manager Thabile handled the situation, but I hope this email will reach the right hands and all this will be rectified.

Checkers,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Northern Region,Checkers Van Der Lingen,COMPLAINT,STORE,ENVIRONMENT,Checkers Responsive Web,Mice in store,"Good day

I live and work in Paarl. Conveniently Chcekers Van Der Lingen is within walking distance from the offices where I work. Needless to say I shop there on a weekly basis. I used to love the shop, but in the last two years the way things are done is quite questionable.

I would like to point out a few factors that are quite concerning. On three different occasions I've seen mice at the bread section - running around on the bread shelves. On one occasion I saw a rat run form the Deli to the fridges where the cheeses are stocked.

On one occasion in the past i bought cocktail sized pies from the bakery. There weren't any fillings in it.

Yesterday I bought a tray of chicken fillets, but I had to return it because of a bed smell, and the fillets had a tinge of green to it.

When in store for my return, three other customers returned chicken bought from the deli.

This is not the Checkers Van der Lingen I've grown accustomed to.

Is there still such a thing as random inspection?

I don't think Checkers Van der Lingen is on standard  concerning service delivery. I am a loyal customer as many others. I think we could agree that things are generally expensive in the times that we live in.

I know that retail is highly target driven, but service delivery should be on the same standard shouldn't it?

I had given my parents R300.00 worth of vouchers to use at their convenience but this was anything but a convenience by Keano Jaftha at your Checkers brand at Wesgate mall in Mitchell's plain. 

The vouchers had first and foremost been attained by Pioneer foods which is now PepsiCo which is a yearly gift offered to staff but I assure you this will change. I dont seem to understand why vouchers may be frowned upon if hundreds of thousands are spent by an establishment for their staffs perusal. Or was it a case of one cashier, 2 supervisors and a manager being completely incompetent as to get my fathers blood pressure up over a R13.00 that needed to be utilized in order for the voucher transaction to take place. Was it not your staff who should have advised him further on how to complete this, nope.

I hope that you are doing well and staying safe during this trying time that we are in. 

My name is Faika Abrahams, and I am the chairman of registered non-profit organization based in the heart of Athlone, we are known as the Sunflower Community Outreach. 

We have been doing everything in our power since 2018 to make sure that the underprivileged people in the community, children and seniors have a plate of food and are able to experience things that they may have never been able to experience before. 
We have begun planning our cooking schedule for 2022 and have come to the realization that we may not be able to cook everyday as planned due to a lack of sponsors. 

We have recently opened our own little library where the children in the area are allowed to come and collect books and keep them for a certain amount of time, as schools have returned back to normal, we would also like to hand out sandwiches on these days. 

With that being said, I would like to appeal to your company for the donation of any food ingredients towards pots of food for the seniors and underprivileged people and children within and outside of the community, these donations can be anything from vegetables to tin goods, every little bit helps. 

We hope that you will consider assisting us in providing our seniors and underprivileged people and children with a plate of food or even a sandwich at least thrice a week. 

Yours in the true spirit of Ubuntu
Regards

I try to give the pool the best care possible and we cover it after every use.

Please pass this on to the relevant department. I want to stay anonymous, for obvious reasons. I'm a woman of 2 kids and a husband living in the edenvale area. 2 years ago, my husband And I both lost our jobs due to Covid and we basically fell into hard times. It was so bad that we had to sell almost everything we worked our entire lives for. I'm a very proud person but my last hope was just to send a message on Facebook to ask for help. You won't believe me, but in a matter of minutes a lady by the name of Janine, who works for a NGO called compass, messaged me and asked me what I needed. The very same day I met her at her shelter, and she gave me so much food which she received from checkers. Not only that, she also replaced almost everything in my house that we had to sell, like appliances, as well as my husband's tools, and much more. And on top of that, her husband came to our house with all these things and set up everything without us lifting a finger. I was so shocked and amazed at what these 2 people have done that I wanted to find out more about compass and them. Talking to some the people that they house, I found out that these 2 people work 7days a week, till late at night, doing things for the community. The day that I came to see the ladies in the shelter, Janine's husband was going through all the things that checkers has donated. He was sitting in that hot garage for hours cleaning and fixing things, so that they could sell it to buy an oxygen machine for another lady who was seriously sick from Covid and the hospital's couldn't do anything for her. And Ive heard so many stories of the good Janine(compass) has done. So when I decided to pop in to say hi, I found out that checkers was not sending their non foods to her anymore, due to someone making a complaint. It honestly hurt me, to find that a few individuals who only have the needy  peoples interest at heart has been cut off like this. I'm a good example of what Janine has done, I've witnessed the dedication from her an her husband, tirelessly working to help those who have just hit rock bottom, and checkers, eventhough a silent helper, also responsible for saving so many people's lives. You don't know the good things that have been done with the stuff received from you. I mean, compass is based in edenvale, but their reach of goodness is all over the place, Durban, Cape town, all over Joburg. And if you think that they are benefitting themselves  from all the stuff you were sending, you are so wrong. And now that they not receiving things anymore, I could see the worry on her face of what and how they can help people now. You need to send someone to come and find out for yourself the amazing work that Janine and her husband,with the helping hand of a few others are doing.",1337993,#,#,21/01/2022,Completed,Yanelisa Gulwa,Anon,Anon,+27 823405666,21/01/2022,Careline,7303

I need this message to be escalated to the CEO or Senior Management because a normal Customer Care employee does not necessarily have control over decisions taken on executive levels,  We are clients of checkers for many years and we love your shops and products, therefore the complaint is not about that.

My complaint is about the service Walk in Clients experience since the implementation of Sixty60.

We have now experienced this in the following branches and I can ensure you that this is probably happening all over : Queenswood Pretoria, Ecopark Pretoria, Checkers Hyper - Centurion and Checkers Hartbeespoort.
The staff that collects the orders as they received the online order (Sixty60) does not care how they push into or bump Walk in clients in the process.  
I do understand that you have a mandate to live up to with regards to the service you promise via Sicty60, but it should not at to the cost of your Walk in client base.
I do understand that you have a mandate to live up to wrt the service you render via Sicty60, but it should not be to the cost of your walk in client base.
If this continue,  you will definitely loose  your Walk in Clients.

I trust that that matter will be discussed at the executive level and that I can at least expect some feedback.

For past few months, I have been observing your quality of service and I can confirm that it is extremely poor.  Especially at your Deli section.  For some strange and stupid reasons, you hide or don't freely offer fork/ knife/ spoons.  Why that is the case, only you know.  Initially I thought it was only at one store where I first experienced this but now I can conclude that it is everywhere.  I experienced this at Alberton New Market, Polokwane (there it was worse because I was even questioned before it could be provided), Boksburg, Sunward Park, The Reef in Germiston and Sandton City.

Few minutes ago, I experienced it at Sandton City.  What made it worse is that your employee even turned her back on me while I was talking.  I wanted muesli and yogurt but because you do not offer spoons, I ended up not buying it.   I bought a salad and after I had to ask for it, I was provided with some useless wooden spoon.

My family and friends have been warning me about Checkers/ Shoprite but didn't listen.  It was definitely my last time I set my foot at your store.

2 eggs is little. But what If y'all taking out 2 eggs from every pack. That's a lot of extra money for checkers. Also if I was even R2 short. Checkers would never have let me had the eggs. So 2 eggs short for my money that I paid is unfair.

I went to the Checkers Hyper Platinum square in Rustenburg to exchange the product.The manager who assisted me was not very helpful and unwilling to assist me.I wanted to EXCHANGE the product for either the same product or something in the similar price range and  was even willing to pay any difference.The manager informed me that i could not exchange or return the product as it was against the company policy for items sold on the ""red label"". I now have a product that I have paid R500.00 for which is of no use to me.I am rather upset as I find this hard to believe that a huge company like Checkers has such policies in place. We were not even informed about such policies when we purchased the product. There are also no terms and conditions of sale on the tax invoice as well.As loyal customers of Checkers, I am not a happy customer and would like to have this matter resolved ASAP.",1309605,Russel Hobs,Retro Kettle,10/01/2022,Completed,Estrolita September,#,Fatima,#,10/01/2022,Careline,50534

Several times I have tried to purchase from the 60 sixty app and I was refused the purchase due to having no funds even though I have over 100 K on the card. It seems that you don't want our money. Lastly, and most importantly id like to complain about the manager. My sons iPhone got stolen in December, if the manager was doing his job we could have gotten the phone back before the thief left. We knew quickly that it was stolen and it was online for 30 minutes. It took over 20 minutes and 4 announcements for him to bother coming to address us and request for camera footage to be viewed. There was nobody of authority there to take over from his duties either while he wasn't there. Just for us to find out he was on the toilet the entire time. His incompetence cost us a 20k phone. His only remark was that 3 phones had been stolen that week already as if that is my problem. The camera people were quick to locate where and when the incident took place and find a description of the thieves. Imagine if he was there to request the review straight away. Someone should be on the floor to assist with these matters at all times, I should know as I was a retail manager for 25 years myself.

My concern is that you have your checkers staff packing the shelves and pushing things around in the middle of people doing their shopping which adds to extremely busy environment. 
I am waiting for 30 minutes in the queue which is going into the aisle and haven't moved at all. There are more cashiers closed than open. Surely you as management know very well that this is a busy period. At least put in a few more cashiers to lessen the load of the current few that are evidently struggling with the work load. 

Please address this as you are about to lose a loyal customer. I know you might not care that I am on my way to pick n pay right now but if that's the attitude towards all your customers then you really do not have customer satisfaction in your forefront 

Please address this as soon as possible.

Checkers Hyper,Natal Checkers Division,Ch Hyper Region,Checkers Hyper Gateway,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CONTRACT SECURITY,Checkers Responsive Web,Mistreated by security,"On the 15th January 2022 I bought Wine from your shop . To cut a long story short as I was exiting the shop with my daughter I was called aside by your security saying they suspect I did not pay for Wine. I then showed them a slip that I did purchase the wine and it was not stolen

One of the security guards requested that they also see a bank notification from my phone of the purchase. Confused I did pull out my phone and showed them the purchase notification. I then asked is a slip not enough why the invasion of my privacy of having to check my purchases on my phone as well????the guy answered by saying they wanted to see if the date collided with the one on the slip 

I have never been so violated and embarrassed in my entire life and not mention mistreated 

While we were standing there a call came through from their radios ( I assume itï¿½s the person checking the cameras) that they can see that I paid for the Wine

Checkers Hyper,Natal Checkers Division,Ch Hyper Region,Checkers Hyper Gateway,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Consumer Email – Shoprite,Poor Customer Experience,"Dear Shoprite Group TeamI hope you are all doing very well and are safeI am writing to for your much needed help with the poor service and extremely poor management at Checkers which I have experienced on many occasions but the incident which occurred on 27 November 2021is sort of a highlight.I had travelled specifically to this Checkers Hyper Store to purchase the Checkers Hyper Value pack of 48 Eggs @ R 69.99 but the store did not have any stock of these eggs at all, I had also needed to purchase some other essential items which were on promotion together with the Sea Harvest 800g Fish Fingers X2 @ R 100 , but I did not manage to purchase anything at all.The store was extremely busy without anywhere to even move through between aisles or even find a spot to have a little breathing space, yes I, fully understand that stores are busy on black Friday and black Friday weekend but stores need to be fully stocked to ensure that all customers can benefit from the promotions together with ensuring that wild behaviour does not occur between customers which does occur at this store.The issues with this Checkers Hyper Store are but not limited to the following;ï¿½ Poor Management On An Alround Basesï¿½ Low Stock Levels or No Stock At Of Products At Allï¿½ Craming and Poor Layout Structure Of The Store prohibiting easy movement              around the store to get to other aislesï¿½ Craming On The Way To The Till Point Together With Over Crowding Due To Tills        Not Being In Operation/ Closed or No Cashier Working At Some Till Pointsï¿½ No Staff Members on the store floor to assist Customers in Various                              Departmentsï¿½ No Stock of Pet Supply Products Specifically ï¿½Pet Shop Productsï¿½(Other Stores With No Stock Of This Product Include; Shoprite Phoenix/ Shoprite     Mount Egecombe/ Checkers Cornubia &amp; The Terrible Checkers Hyper Gateway)ï¿½ Checkers Hyper Gateway wasted all of my time and money by costing me a                parking fee plus travel to and from the store together with putting me at a high risk    of contracting COVID 19 due to the overcrowding which indicates again poor              management.ï¿½ Neatness, Sanitation at this store is quite bad whereby the floors/ fridges and            shelves are dirty at times for example the egg aisles had eggs burst everywhere on    the floor creating a rather messy spaceï¿½ The Store Manager does not care about Customers at all from my experience as        while I was in the store I had gone to see the manager and a staff member in one      of the offices advised me on where her office is but unfortunately she was not            around, I had then phoned the store the next day and a staff member answered          and I explained her as to what my complaint is and she stated that the manager        again was not around but she will advise her on what my complaint entails and          she will give me a call back but unfortunately I received no feedback at all which        certainly means that the manager does not care at all.ï¿½ Contamination of fresh foods at the Deli which I have seen on many occasions at      this store and others groups stores as well whereby the fresh chips, I, had                    purchased had the smell of beef/ meat which is not suitable for vegetarians                together with seeing the utensils used on meat products were the same used on        products suitable for consumption by vegetarians and I, had also purchased a            chicken peri peri pie which layered turned out to be a steak and kidney when I had      already got home.My experience with this store has always been terrible, unsafe and very   unwelcoming which is why I, try my best to stay away from this store alwaysI do not ever feel happy shopping at Checkers Hyper GatewayPlease assist further, I really need your helpDo Take Care &amp; Stay SafeHave a Lovely &amp; Blessed Day furtherBest Regards: Shyam SinghNotice: This email contains personal information and should not be routed out to third parties without obtaining permission from the master sender and it's subsidiaries in terms of the Protection Of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013Disclaimer:https://www.shopriteholdings.co.za/email-disclaimer.html",1292078,#,#,05/01/2022,Completed,Ryan Sylvester,#,Singh,815671146,05/01/2022,Careline,40206

Yesterday (Tuesday 25 January 2022) I brought in a bottle of Harvest Table Marine Collagen for a return or exchange. As I mentioned to you yesterday the above product caused me to have diarrhea, vomiting and deep stomach pain. Furthermore, after having experienced these symptoms I researched the product and found no clinical trials were done to check it's safety for human consumption. Considering that this product is a health risk I asked you for a return or exchange of the product. You promised to contact Head Office regarding this and to contact me today it is now 13.30 and I have still not heard from you. As a pensioner with osteoarthritis I invested a lot of money in this product and as a regular customer at Checkers who does my monthly shopping with you, surely I deserve consideration? If I do not hear from you regarding this return or exchange, you will leave me with no option but to take the matter up on social media and with the consumer watch.

The lady gave me the gift card &amp; I then collected a trolley to shop all the necessary &amp; important things my baby needed. I spent a long time in the shop, it was probably a half hour or more. When I thought I had everything I needed, I went to cash up at the till. After all the selected items were scanned &amp; packed, the total bill came to R3900 and just as I was handing the voucher for payment, the lady from the money market ran up to me and said there was something wrong with the voucher.Apparently she loaded the voucher incorrectly and gave me more money than she should have. The way she approached me was as if I had stolen something from the shop. She called the supervisor and the supervisor told me to pay R3900 for the goods. I told her I didn't have the money, so she said well then give the voucher back. There was no formal apology for the error they had made, nor did they show any form affection or compassion. I was so embarrassed, and what's worse was the fact that I had to leave all the items that were so carefully selected during that long time spent in store.After the confrontation, I found myself shaking and almost in tears. I handed the voucher back without a fuss, I then said I need to at least buy the aqueous cream &amp; soap. I then extracted those items from the shopping bags, paid an additional R5 and left the store. There was Xtra savings card being swiped, which is another cause for concern. I don't even own one, so who gets the benefits on that card??I am really disappointed, I'm in shock, I've been humiliated, embarrassed and shamed and I am making you aware of It. It was not my fault that the employee made an error, why did I have pay greatly for her mistake?",1283028,#,#,02/01/2022,Completed,Alize Feris,Robyn,Mannyn Jeffries,835431755,02/01/2022,Careline,2701

Dear Sir

As leader of your compony you understand the importance of hard work to make a success in life and to make your dreams become a reality. Since my girlfriend was little her biggest dream was to build a mansion. She is currently working at the Treatery in Howick KZN as an HR accountant and want to study a course in human resources to gain knowledge so she can broaden her knowledge to get a better work and accomplish her dreams. She also has the vision to open her own business in the future. 

It is really hard to get a good job without good qualification and experience.

My girlfriend wantï¿½s to applied to study human resources at the Academy of York College part time but there are some difficulties she need to overcome to be able to study:
1.	She does not have the funding to pay for the human resource courses herself.
2.	Her current work possession does not pay enough for her to be able to pay for the studies.
3.	For some of the courses they require a minimum salary of R5000 per month and she does not qualify. 
4.	 To get a NQF level 5 diploma in human resources she need an minimum amount of R28700 excluding the things she will need like a laptop.
 
My goal is to raise R50000 in order for my girlfriend to fully pay for the diploma and buy her a laptop.   The reason for this letter to gain your support with her studies so my girlfriend will be able to accomplish her diploma. Every little bit of your support will make a very big difference. 

We would like to thank you in advance for your support. Please feel free to contact me at 081 392 0868 or Bianca Muller at 083 791 5234 or at verweylouis@gmail.com.

To Whom It may Concern


This email is long overdue and I would like to inquire why the flavours of the best tasting yoghurt, DARLING YOGHURT, was changed more or less a year+ ago.

Me and my family have been emptying thousands of 1kg tubs over last 20 years and recently we find ourselves buying only 1 or 2 tubs per month. 

The old flavours of Darling Yoghurt was by far the best tasting yoghurt over all, comparing to all the other famous brands that are also available on the shelves. Darling has a taste that is truely yoghurt and not an artificial taste like all other brands.

I have called Darling and they told me that they have received hundreds of complaints about their new range. The message which was carried over by them, was that, there were some pressure from the distributors for the renewal of the DARLING YOGHURT brand. Some of the new flavours are really not what one expect from a fruity tasting yoghurt.

I think I speak for a lot of consumers who agree that we are missing the old flavours that are no longer available.

I hope that Checkers will reconsider and will start a conversation with DARLING DIARIES to see if you can bring us back all the old tasty flavours. 

I hope to here from Checkers management soon and too also see a change on the diary shelves one of these days.

Kind regards

Checkers Hyper,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Hyper Region,Checkers Hyper N1 City,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Checkers Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"I have been a happy Checkers supporter for many, many years but not today!!

Yesterday I purchased two fold up outdoor chairs @ R179.99 each. I later decided to test one out. I tried to unfold the chair but it was a little tight, thought maybe it was like that due to not been used. When I sat on it, the chair collapsed and I fell on the tiles in a painful heap! I needed help to get up from my husband.

Today we returned both chairs to Checkers. The lady helping us hardly said a work other than to ask if we wanted to exchange them. I mentioned to her what had happened and that I was in a lot of pain! No response or apology was given!

I feel your front line staff / cashiers / packers dealing with customers need to be better trained and more friendly. Not all, but most of them are sadly lacking in this department.

What an utter disappointment - thereï¿½s hardly stock in the shop, no 6 pack 300ml coke cans, only lemon flavored pump 6 packs, shelves at canned goods are poorly stocked and variety is so limited, fresh fruit and veg was the best cause there was hardly anything and the prepacked salad bowls has seen better days - green leaves are now brown, ready made meals had no options - there were a full 4 flavors to choose from, cold meats sliced and prepacked - empty shelves. This store has a clear management problem, planning arenï¿½t done properly and the shop is extremely dirty.  I normal drive all the way to the Brackenfell fairbridge branch (and I stay in Panorama) simply because itï¿½s well stocked, has a huge variety to choose from, FRESH fruit and veg, professional and friendly staff. Had a been a Monday at checkers hyper N1, it would be understandable that shelved might be empty, but itï¿½s WEDNESDAY! To top it all I had the worst and most unfriendly service from your cashier at till 5, according to the till slip her nameï¿½s: Yonela NJ. I wasnï¿½t greeted in a friendly manner, simply asked: bag? Whilst she was having a lekker chat with the packer at her till and the packer at till 4. I put the wrong pin in for a card payment - the cashier didnï¿½t tell me, no she decided to announce it to the packer and the till 4 packer. What is really disturbing as that, even though the wearing of face masks is mandatory and you expect all your clients to shop with a mask on covering a mouth and nose - your staff at checkers hyper n1 city is exempted from wearing a face mask correctly. All face masks are either only covering the mouth, hanging loosely on the chin or around the neck - I have noted your staff feel that they may do it to chat to colleagues about their personal life. Even the security check point at the house & home side, who are suppose to ensure all rules are abided by, weï¿½re chatting with masks on the chin.
This is unacceptable Checkers, surely you can do better, greeting a customer in a friendly manner Do not cost a cent - itï¿½s called manners and common decency. Your staff need urgent training, your shop is need of stock. Will checkers hyper N1 see me again, nope definitely not - thereï¿½s other competitive resalers in the same centre.

So I will have to bring them back.I will not be able to drive to Somerset west soon in order to exchange them. Therefore I am forwarding this email now.I will not use the bowls and just put them aside until I can go again which most probably will be only in January.I had to pick up my grandson in Cape Town yesterday, and he was ill. So we had him tested and he tested  positive for Covid.I was the driver of my car, and he was sitting right behind me.

Checkers Hyper,WC Checkers Division,Checkers Hyper Region,Checkers Hyper Sun Valley,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,MANAGEMENT,Telephony,Poor customer experience,"The customer called very distraught with the service at the store. He states that the Branch Manager is the most unfriendly unprofessional Manager he has ever come across. He is never polite and even told customer once that he is too busy to talk, the customer could not believe his ears. How can a Branch Manager be too busy to listen to a Customer's concerns?He also mentioned that rude ""laxidazy"" attitude from the staff derives from the poor leadership provided by the Branch Manager as he is no role model. As per customer should you shop at Hyper Brackenfell, for example, you would find staff assisting in the toiletry aisle, DIY section would have another person and outdoor would also have someone assisting but in this store staff are too busy walking around and leave their job up to the Merchandiser who is more helpful than them. One day he could not find a specific item and spoke with a supervisor who told him to go look in the fridges like he didn't do that before approaching her. As per the customer the poor service is horrific at the store and he cannot believe that the Branch Manager is allowed to continue with such poor service and nothing is done to change his attitude because if something was done, his service would improve which it does not.""cherry on the cake"" was when the customer called the store enquiring about delivery areas for Sixty60, instead of the switchboard assistance advising him, we are unable to assist with that kindly contact Sixty 60 on ---- -- -- --. no, she just transfer the call to ""somewhere"" and it just rings and rings till it goes dead.

Please note that ALL my previous orders with you have had a problem too. I will NEVER be ordering from you AGAIN and will take my money somewhere else.
1. your stock availability should be shown before checkout and NOT AFTER checkout, understandably 1 item might have system defect but not half the items in the basket!
2. Your generated google maps should reflect the exact delivery address given as to NOT confuse drivers.
3. Drivers should be knowledgeable navigators and at least be able to give landmarks so that the customer can help them.
4. How does a driver tell a customer heï¿½s running out of airtime, this is unprofessional and ridiculous!
5, A driver should not be telling the customer off, AGAIN outrageous behaviour. 
5. Then after numerous customer service calls, you cancel my order, no reason or apology.
6. Your option to reorderï¿½re-ordering then costs me another bank charge which you donï¿½t cover all because of the ignorance of your system and driver.

Hope youï¿½re happy with your terrible service because you have lost a customer.

On Saturday 22 January 2022,I visited the store in question's liquor section.

The price of Red Square Vodka was on display for R139,99,which clearly displayed a 750ml bottle and a juice included. At the cashier the amount qas indicated as R164 +,we disputed the transaction respectfully,but was denied the sale after we already purchased the soft drinks and ice to go with the expected purchase. 

I feel truly disappointed and decided to leave the merchandise and go to another opposition liquor store.

In the parking area after having to calm myself,I decided to go to the store manager to report the issue.

I have been a loyal customer of the store,but qith this type of experience,will truly think tqice to return to this store.

Went to an opposition store to make the purchase accompanying the softdrinks and ice already purchase ,as the temperature of the day qas over 36ï¿½ and dearly wanted to get out of the heat.

Appeal to you in sincerity to please attend to the client service at the store in question.

Yes I know that for both DP Breweries and Checkers there are phone numbers. But I prefer to use email and to have things in writing.:A month ago local Checkers Liquor stores had 'Devils Peak Lager' at R130/doz. I'm familiar with DP's excellent 'King's Blockhouse IPA and thought their Craft Lager worth a try at that price (similar cost to Castle etc.) .. --&gt; In fact it is awful.I wrote to Devil's Peak telling them what I thought of their over-rated Lager. I have not had the courtesy of a reply and I hope that someone at Checkers will make an effort to acknowledge a complaint. Quite simply I would like my money back. I still have 8 or 9 bottles unopened. This beer is flat!This maybe is the worst Lager I've ever tried and I would be surprised if no-one else complained. But then S.Africans don't really do that; do they!I attach a copy of the email i sent Devils Peak to which they did not respond.

Alstein went to the back and returned approximately 10 minutes later advising her there is stock but Geona is mopping and she will need to wait for the floor to dry as Geona is not allowing her to walk on the floor. The customer was so furious she could not believe her ears. Firstly the stock should have been on the floor the following day, secondly was Alstein just to lazy to fetch it? Thirdly how can a cleaner decide the mopping the floor is more important than a customer, do the floor or the customers pay their salary. The customer says she even has the RM Phillip on her cellphone because of the continuous complaints but did not feel like typing a message. As per customer, Phillip is really trying to help improve service at the store but it is like the mentality is that it is a poor area and therefore customers can be disrespected.

What do you as a retail store feel its lacking on the transportation services delivery that non of the companies have been able to deliver or offered before.

If in any case you have your own transportation as SHOPRITE and don't work with transportation companies. What haven't you been able to achieve in the transport/supply department?

He promised to send me an email to admit it was not my fault but until today I have received nothing. I had back surgery not too long ago and I got really hurt with this fall, I would not do this deliberately because I need to take care of m back otherwise they will have to operate again.  I hurt my back ral bad with the fall, my coccyx and my wrist and knee as well. the wrist was just sprained and is okay. but my back and knee still hurts, and I have severe pain when i walk. This means that I will go have to see a specialist and I cannot do it ow since work is hectic.  I missed Christmas and New Year due the pain i was experiencing, I could not work for two weeks I just laid in bed because it was too painful to move.  So what do we do about this, My salary is R14109.10, which means I get R470.30 per day x 14 days no work = R6584.25, and that is not all, I have received an account from Ferncrest Hospital that I owe them R233, and I am not going to pay that.  So tell me what happens next are you going to settle my loss of income or shall i ask a lawyer to handle this for me which is going to cost you more since I am innocent in all this and you will be paying my lawyer at the end of the day as well. Also you need to compensate me for pain and suffering, but the amount is up to you. Since I am still suffering from back and knee pain, see the pics of my knee attached. Please refer to the correct department, because I wanted to be civil and asked that manager over and over again to send me and email, and my medical aid might also still send me an account for the ambulance that picked me up from shoprite as they don't work through provincial ambulance services, they use ER24. Your cooperation will be highly appreciate it as it seem your manager at that specific store is unfit to do his job. Thank you.  Annelle M Retief, 0713781038

When I went to the till to pay the cashier said they will not consider my empty bottles as it is 15min before they close I should pay full price. 
II asked why she said the manager said so. 
I paid full price and asked for the. Manager, Eugene the manager showed up. 
I explained the situation and he refused to give me the receipt that I brought empty bottles which were now in the shops possession. I said to him that... I have paid full price but give me receipt to acknowledge bottles taken, his response was that when I come back he will remember me. 
Really is that how managers are trained to deal with customers.
If indeed it is policy that no empty bottles will be accepted 15min before shop closes, can a clear notice be displayed.
I feel like I was robbed it was not much to the next person but it is still money.

Why it was not indicated that I must get from checkers? My argument was based on the displayed item on sale promotion. The Manager said even liquor is displayed on the samepromotion sale, but you go to liquor store to get. My argument was that they have item in store that is displayed on the promotion sale. My other argument is that it was not stated on the promotion sale that some items were on sale only at checkers even ifthey have the item in store.

Shoprite,Shoprite Gauteng Division,Soweto East Region,Shoprite Ennerdale,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CASHIER,Shoprite Responsive Web,Terrible Customer Service,"Good day sir/madam

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I trust that you are well

I am sending this complaint in regards to the poor customer service we have been receiving at the Ennerdale Shoprite. My mother is a pensioner and whenever she goes to a till that doesn't have money she has to run around asking every cashier if they have enough money and in the processes treated like she is a irritation . The last time she we tried to ask the supervisor she first had her own personal conversation before attending to my mother. Some tellers are also disrespectful especially when we ask to withdraw money from the till one even threw change in my hand. Not to mention the Lenasia Shoprite at Signet Terrance, we will never go back there again. We tried withdrawing money from the designated till, when we approached the till the cashier she told us that we had to form a line on the outside and then wait to be called to the till, however she had no one at the till and we were the only people there at the time requesting a withdrawal, yet she still refused to help as also engaged in a personal conversation with another staff member

We buy our daily groceries from Shoprite because of their great competitive pricing but receiving terrible customer service as we have been will force us to rather pay higher prices at establishments that prioritize the customers. We're not asking to be treated like kings and queens but just with basic respect and for people to be competent  and do their jobs. My mother even gets anxious on the says she has to go get the money because of the rude treatment she receives

Should they be stolen who will be at fault?I truly disappointed in the store because with other stores they close the bags with a tape or you can place them at the parcel counter.Your response will be highly appreciated and I am not letting this one go because I had to go home without the items I needed.,1341654,#,#,22/01/2022,Completed,Julien Mafouta,Nqwenelwa,Jobela,#,22/01/2022,Careline,7476

Shoprite,Shoprite Gauteng Division,North Rand Region,Shoprite Kempton Park,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CONTRACT SECURITY,Shoprite Responsive Web,Treated like a criminal,"Good Day, 

I am writing this email to complain about the humiliation that I have just received Shoprite in Kempton Park - Central Ave around 1:30 PM today. 

I bought a few items at the store and paid at till 7. I don't know what I did with the till slip and only realised when the security asked for it at the door that I'd lost it. 

When I was about to leave, the security asked for the till slip - which I realised I had lost. So they wouldn't let me out without producing the slip. 

At first I went to the cashier I paid at and asked if she could go back and print another one for me as only 1 or 2 people had paid after me - which she said she couldn't (according to my knowledge slips can be saved and retrieved by cashiers). I then looked around to see if I'd dropped it and looked in my bag and still couldn't find it. 

So I went back to the security and asked if they can ask a manager or whoever to sort this out so I can leave. To the security's excitement, he took my groceries and asked that I follow him to what I'm assuming is a control room/ some office. A Shoprite staff member with an attitude (and he'll know what I'm referring to) then came and asked the till I paid at and the amount, and was able to retrieve the slip in seconds. 

My actual complaint here is about how this thing was handled - firstly the security who's probably had nothing exciting going on for him the whole day makes a judgment that I might have stolen the stuff by the way he carried on. That guy treated me like I was some thief in a store full of people. 
If no one can get out with their groceries without the slip- why is there no disclaimer saying so because I never keep grocery receipts?  
If the slip can be retrieved, why must I be following the security around and taken to the store's back rooms when I could've just stood there by the door with another security that was there, while he does the up and down by himself to see if I'd stolen the stuff or not. 

After that ordeal, when they've finally retrieved the slip- I did not even get an apology. Instead on my way out, the female security asks if the goods are really mine. 

What kind of service is this? Is it because of the store predominantly caters for a certain race group which never complains about service? Superior service is reserved for stores in areas catering for certain LSMs? 

The store and it's contractors can do better.

Shoprite,Shoprite Gauteng Division,North Rand Region,Shoprite Mall Of Tembisa,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,CONTRACT SECURITY,Shoprite Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"I am disappointed in the way Shoprite employees and the security  guards handled a simple matter that was at hand. Coming from work very tired I am thinking that I need to do my groceries. I went to Shoprite Mall of Tembisa as it is the nearest shop and I enjoy doing my shopping there. As I was paying for my groceries at the till the cashier Nyeleti is helping me  to pay and after that she was packing my groceries she leaves 2 items and immediately I let her know that she did not pack these 2 items and she just stares at me with attitude on her face and I had to pack them. As I left the till I was on my way to the exit, as I got to the exit the security guards stopped me and asked for my receipt. I searched for the receipt in my handbag when I couldn't find it I told them I had paid for my groceries but they didn't listen to me. They manhandled me stopping me from passing the exit just because I told them that I lost my receipt. I then told the  security guard lady that she can't stop me from passing the exit because I paid. She then called other security people to block me as if I stole when I didn't. I tried pushing them stopping them from blocking my way so that I can go home and prepare dinner for my family. One male security came to the exit door and immediately lifted and carried me and took me to the admin office. While they carried me Busi Lorraine Maluka pulled my hair roughly as if we are fighting. I did not like the way he was carrying me because he was touching my private part all the way till I got to the admin office. When I got to the admin office there were a group of ladies who were laughing about my situation. I got surprised when I got there because the ladies there were joking about what happened instead of coming with the solution and calming the customer as it was not the best experience. Luckily after that one lady came to me and asked what happened and I explained everything. She calmed me and started resolving my situation. Me standing in the office admin I became a clown and it was a circus as they came in one by one to stress me even more instead of calming me down. Outrageously one other lady made a comment saying that I should know that in the black community Shoprite Checkers it is their procedure that they should always make sure that the black customers don't steal and they must be searched and should also produce proof to prove that they did not steal. It is inappropriate for the Shoprite's employee to blare that out even if it is the procedure. I am also disappointed that Shoprite has rules that are racist that in black communities we should be treated like trash but in white communities they should be treated with respect. Even worse my groceries were all over the place and my bank card is now broken which is an additional cost they have to deduct in my bank for me to replace the bank card. The shirt that I was wearing is also torn because they were manhandling me. The worst thing is that I was wearing my work uniform, this has tarnished my name and I don't think I'll ever be comfortable shopping at Shoprite Mall of Tembisa. I am still traumatised by the experience and don't think I will recover from that.

I never felt so belittled and humiliated in my life as if I stole while I paid for everything. The only sin I had made is that I was trying to exit the shop without drama and with the goods that are fully paid. I think Shoprite should start investing in training their customer to good customer service and treating customers with respect. We take our our hard earned  money to support Shoprite and their employees don't respect that. I also work with customer and I make sure that I treat customers with respect because without them it means that I don't have my work.

I would also like to thank the lady who helped to resolve the situation calmly. Out of all the people who were present in the office she is the only one who was helpful and dealt with everything professionally. I commend her for her professionalism and good customer service.

I hope this matter will be dealt with urgency.

Shoprite,Shoprite Gauteng Division,Vaal Region,Shoprite Marks Park,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,LONG QUEUES,Shoprite Responsive Web,"Few open tills, long queues","On the 11th of January 2022, i went to buy school Stationary and groceries at Shoprite Vereeniging. The customer service in your shop is pathetic and shocking. As busy as it was with back to school preparation the shop had 6 till opened. Five was for items more than 10 and 1 was an express till. The shop was packed, one would swear it was Black Friday. The store was packed and queues were very long. As i was finalizing my purchase it was difficult to get some items from the shelves because the queues were blocking us from searching for items we were looking for. The people in the queues were getting irritated with  ?shoppers asking them to move because they have been on the queues for more that an hour. Some customers were fighting in the shop because the customer said to they guy ""Move"" the guy retaliated and said ""are you instructing me or is it a request"". Both client were right the problem here was Shoprite not doing anything to manage the situation. I wanted to cry when i saw an old lady sitting on the floor waiting for her turn to pay. What happened to ""Ubuntu"" and taking care of our senior citizens? We need to remember that some of these elders have chronic diseases, why do we have to make them wait for more that an hour to pay? One day one of your customer will leave the shop with an Ambulance stretcher if you continue treating senior citizens they way your shop does. Should i only worry about elders? Then my turn came to pay for my items, then i realised it's  my turn to be irritated by customers pushing me with  trollies because they need items they came to buy. I went to the office and asked to speak to someone regarding the service. I spoke to Wayne, I asked him why do they have 5 till's opened when there's long queues. The response was ""We dont have staff"" . I asked if he was the manager and he said  Lawrence is the manager. When i asked to speak to Lawrence, Wayne said he doesn't know where he is. Wayne was less interested with the issues i was raising. He just didn't care because he walked away without even apologizing for the inconvinience the shop is causing to customers. I went back to the queue and waited for 1hour and 45 min to pay. Shoprite has no respect for its customers. It's like operating your business you are doing us a favour. We are spending money to pay so it would be good to start being considerate. Did it ever occur to you that people love Shoprite because it is affordable? It makes sense why your competitors are coming closer to your shops. Your service is pathetic and soon your customers will understand their value because no one wants to be treated they way you treat your customers. What's more disappointing is that it did not only happen yesterday, its normal thing for customers to wait long in the queues at your Vereeniging branch. If i had permission from all customers i could have taken picture's and posted them on social media but because i understand the law i did not take pictures. Nothing stops me from asking permission from customers when i tell them why Shoprite does not value them. I am very upset that my shopping for R4000 was worth 1hour and 45 minutes and having to deal with your arrogant cashiers. I don't blame them because i asked one of them why is she so grumpy she was honest to say ""I am hungry, i have not eaten lunch and its now 17:45. Then i realised you are not only treating your customers like trash but you are also violating the Labour Relations Act and you are exploiting your employees. These matter should be reported to the department of labour.I am going to visit Shoprite again but this time i wont go as a customer. If i find those long queues, i will make your shop trend for treating customers like trash. I hope you do understand that long waiting time costs you sales and soon these customers will start eating from your shelves because i saw it happening. People were taking items and eating and i don't blame them because it does not make sense to wait for more than an hour on a shop that has more than 12 tills. I understand that you can't open all tills at the same time but understand your customers feet flow then the manager can plan accordingly. Month ends he has to have enough staff to operate the tills. All i see here is that the manager hardly walk to floor to check things in the shop. You know why pick n pay has junior managers cubicle by the tills?  it's for them to identify issues  and attend to  customers. At shoprite you have to look for a manager then we come cross people like Wayne who don't care what you are saying. Please visit your shop and view cameras you will see the torture you're doing to your customers. I hope the issues i hraised above will be attended to.

I asked on lady with a Shoprite tack oh herself and she told me that she is not allowed to assist, the guys at the bakery were also busy and couldn't help I was there for over 7 minutes without assistance, until one lady not sure whether she an employee or third party tells me that she'll get somebody to assist. That is how I was helped. Secondly I was at the queue to pay and the cashiers were awaiting the supervisor to assist, and it was getting longer.  So I decided to  rather use Kiosk because there were two customers on the queue when i was supposed to pay the cashier told me harshly that she doing me a favour the rules doesn't allow her to cash more than 3 items., I asked her which section of the rule is that why isn't plucked on the board like the 10 items express so that everybody should know and comply. I'm not happy the way she was harshly talking to me and i want to set the record straight that she didn't do me any favour because I paid for the all 10 items I bought that was her responsibility as a cashier to assist when there is a need. Her supervisor indicated that she saw me and could stop me because of the long queues.

During the scuffle they stole my iPhone 11 from my top jacket pocket. The store was so busy, they all vanished into the store. I only fully realised that it must of been a organised gang.

Today I wanted to purchase loaves of R8 baked bread in order to give it out as charity to workers sitting on the corners of yhe roads. When  I got to the till, they advised that I can only purchase 3 loaves, however there was no sign stating that I can only purchase 3. I explained to 3 different people including a Guy named Vuyisilo supposedly the manager to explain that I wanted to hand out the bread to charity for those guys who cannot afford the a simple R8 loaf of bread. I am disgusted in the service of Shoprite Ridgeway as they had no signs of the amount of bread allowed to purchase.  Surely they can bake more bread should there be a shortage. How can you be so heartless to not allow a customer to purchase bread to give to the less fortunate. I will never support the store again as they have no sense of humanity. I will further distribute this complaint on other platforms. South Africa will never move into the right direction because their own people only care about their own needs and not of the less fortunate.",1298472,#,#,07/01/2022,Completed,Renate Coetzee,Raabia,Tree,+27 847063829,07/01/2022,Careline,628

Shoprite,Shoprite Gauteng Division,Jhb Central Region,Shoprite Riverside Square,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Facebook – Shoprite ZA,Poor customer Service,"Good day Question: Does Shoprite have an electronic system that is used to identify Best Before Dates? I am asking this because I have seen a few complaints from people who have bought expired products and I also experienced the same from Shoprite Riverside Square where the product had a Best Before Date of Nov-2021 and I bought it recently on 9 January 2022.  To add, I went back to return the product and it took more than 20 minutes from the time I handed over the product and the slip to when I finally got my refund of less than R20, again, I think it is unreasonable wait that long for such a simple procedure, I say simple because I have returned goods in other stores and my transaction generally takes 3 to 5 minutes at most. Finally, I went back to the same shelf where I picked up the expired products and found them there still, this was yesterday on the 15th of January 2022 which means many people who are unaware are going to consume products that may not be safe for their health. Actually, I have another comment to make with regards to efficiency, specifically relating to the cashiers. Kindly train them to ask people if they need plastic bags at the beginning of the transaction and the cashier must provide the bag at the earliest possible opportunity and also at the very least open the bag so that we can start packing our goods. Without that implementation we have two problems: One is time because when you give me the bag at the end of the transaction, it will take me/us longer to pack the goods thereby delaying the next transaction since the till only has so much space, in any case, even if the till was bjg enough, there is no reason for the customer to wait if they can start packing the goods earlier. And then as you may be aware, opening plastic bags can be tricky when your hands are dry so it is another frustrating and time wasting process which can be solved easily as suggested above. Your response will be appreciated. ",1324487,#,#,16/01/2022,Completed,Lebo Bloem,Mpho,Makumbane,769621330,16/01/2022,Careline,89236

Fortunately I always check the dates on item I purchase and now I wonder how many unsuspecting customers bought expired Clover Nolac Milk. I opted to buy Clover Low Fat Fresh Milk rather than expired milk.See attached photos as proof of my complaint.@Checkers/Shoprite - I'm always disappointed whenever I go shopping at Shoprite Southgate Value Mart and Ridgeway. Customers service at these shops is very poor. My recent experiences have been (1) being in a queue for 30min waiting to pay at an express till (2) staff members chatting to each other and not helping customers (3) staff not wearing their face masks properly... it seems the one thing they get right is their well manicured nails and flawless hairstyles. I always find a better shopping experience at Checkers vs Shoprite. I live in Soweto and I find Checkers Colombine Square and Glenvista the saving grace as they give me reason to keep supporting the Checkers brand. I wonder if the poor customer service one gets from Shoprite has to do with the demographics the brand serves vs Checkers that is mainly located in affluent areas? #mythoughts.@CloverSA - I hope that you will take this complain up with the Management of Shoprite Southgate as they have compromised your product and brand.Regards,Tshidi Kgole073 126 5399",1363260,Clover,Nolac,28/01/2022,Completed,Shandre Permall,Tshidi,Kgole,+27 731265399,28/01/2022,Careline,58231

He claims his son was treated like he has stolen the item where as he bought. While they were keeping his son at the store as if he is a criminal, some random guy approached his son; he then asked for R10 and said he will help sorting out the matter. His son gave this person the requested money assuming he is one of the merchandising people as he did come across one that was not wearing uniform and at this stage he was panicking as he did not know what was going on.

Shoprite,WC Shoprite Division,Southern Suburbs Region,Shoprite Adderley Street,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,MANAGEMENT,Shoprite Responsive Web,Service complaint,"On the 16/01/2022 I went to buy a scientific calculator. On the shelf the price tag was R100. When at the till point it rang R169. I queried that this was not the price that was displayed and marked at the shelf. A controller checked and indeed found that this was the case.

The Manager on duty by the name Cidwell (Fresh Food Manager) indicated to the controller that he will not allow me to pay the displayed price as such I should have read the barcode and the item features. I was shocked and livid. Is it the responsibility of customer to read barcodes when we buy at Shoprite.

The one Manager Cidwell outrightly refused me to pay the displayed price and ended up paying R69 extra. I did not appreciate the way I was treated by your Manager. He was condescending, disrespectful and arrogance at highest order. 

As a customer I believe I should have been given the item with the price displayed but he remostrated and refused as if it was packed by me. I am not happy about this treatment. Your Manager interactions with customers should change if at all that's how he deals with customers. I deserve to be respected as a customer. I only got respect from the controller compared to the Manager who should lead by example. 

Moreover he even indicated that I can report anywhere he does not care. Let me be clear here even if the displayed price was R200 or any amount I would have paid. Here the issue was the displayed price was the amount I was prepared to pay.

Good day

My husband bought school books last Friday, 14 January 2022,at your branch in adderley Street,Cape Town. 
Today when I wanted to cover the books, I noticed that he bought the wrong type of books. He was supposed to buy the normal 2 quire hardcover, but he purchased the quad & margin. 
I would like to know if its possible that we can change it. He does not have the slip anymore as he bought it just before he started work the morning.
He did swipe his savings card tho', so if u are able to track his purchase from there, it would be a blessing.
He bought other stuff too,the list was as follows:
3x3quire books
6x2quire books
1x Casio calculator
2x5pk Manchester utd book covers
1x2pk staedtler glue stick
He was there as soon as the store opened,as he was waiting for them to open.

I would appreciate some feedback in this regard.
Thank you

I have been to the store on several occasions and have enquired about the stamp collection  books but were given mixed answers.I was told that there is no stamp books yet and when I asked someone else on the same day then I was told that the books are kept for people who does hampers and they reserve the books for them as they have the priority when it comes to the stamp collection books.I just have one question.What about the loyal customers that is shopping daily at this specific store.Are we also not a priority as a consumer and is it because the average loyal consumer is not buying enough at a time as oppose to the guys buying stuff for their hampers.

I asked Management to pull up footage because I made quite a scene in a very stressed manner,  not even the cashiers lifted their heads to see what is happening so they can alert the security. Management told me that they don't have cameras in the isles.

Guys,  Please. This shop is not safe and I will raise this awareness about this allowed behavior on all social media platforms. You guys are allowing this behavior,  ask your cashiers they will tell you all the information of this pervert.

The take away is right next the storeHe was talking to me in a disrespectful manner After that a senior security person came and asked what is wrongThe lady said let's go to the back and we will lookI thought it will resolve the matterSo I asked are we going to view the footage because this is becoming too muchThe lady then leaves me at the back with this security and a different ladyI repeated that I don't have the slip - the other bag has the groceriesHe keeps asking for the slip and I did not plan to be back at the storeI am sure it won't take them long to check the camerasHe kept asking for the slip - even at the door, he says that I did not declare these itemsI apologised and told him that I was rushingI tried my best to cooperate. I understand that they have a difficult job and I am sure that there is a way to resolve it.The other lady then grabs my bag, I asked her why grab it and not ask.Until you know that I stole here, I should be treated with respect.There were staff coming in and out and she treated them with respect but is not showing the same respect to me.I don't have a problem with you wanting to search me or stopping me.We went back and forth.I offered to take out the items. As I am taking out the stuff - she is looking at the bottom of the bag.There was sugar from Spar, Milk from Spar, Douwe Egberts Coffee 200g, Lifegain supplement.She called over the phone and told someone else that it is from Spar.I asked her if they sell these items here - she did not know.They were treating me like trash. Screaming at me saying don't tell us how to do our jobs.I was feeling scared that they might beat me and I tried my best to cooperate.While I am talking to them, the lady that told us to come to this room comes back and questions me.I understand that I don't have the slip and I understand that people steal but my issue was the manner in which the handled the matter.I then asked if I am guilty or what there conclusion is.I did not declare the items but I don't think that is worth the disrespect I got.They told me to go to the office and they will give me the names.She then pulls me aside and said I would like to apologise for the way they dealth with the matter.She should have addressed this in front of them because they did me wrong.It's like she was just protecting her colleagues and patronizing me.I packed my stuff and followed her but then she was leading me out of the store.I asked to speak to the security's manager.Eventually he gives me the names and I left.I called the number that the lady provided me for the manager but it did not go through.Then I called the store and then said I can come back to the store today and they will arrange a meeting with the manager.I then said that this seems to be escalating - now I am taking time out of my day to resolve this matter.My problem is the way that this matter was handled. The lady that works for Shoprite (she helped me when I bought the monster) apologised.This guy may do this to someone else.After that the lady - the second security guard, she came back and I realised that she was told that I did not steal anything. She just got rid of the guy.She lied to me and said that I will give you the names.They did not apologise.My biggest concern is the disrespect.Customer does not feel comfortable to give the name of the securities.

Shoprite,WC Shoprite Division,Boland Region,Shoprite Paarl 2,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Shoprite Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"Good day
We have a serious complaint against Shoprite Lady Grey, Paarl. 
The service in this store is, and has been, absolutely dreadful, if what is available in the store can even be called ï¿½serviceï¿½. 
ï¿½	Over weekends, which is a very busy, there are AT BEST three or four tills open in a store that has at least twelve to fifteen available. WHY? In a country with such a high unemployment rate Iï¿½m fairly certain there are enough people available to hire to man all the tills. If you canï¿½t find any, I can provide you with an army of people looking for work. 
ï¿½	The cashiers that are actually in the store are rude, unresponsive and unhelpful. They do not greet clients, and if they can be bothered to make eye contact their entire attitude is one of 
ï¿½Iï¿½m doing you a favour to scan these items and you are massively inconveniencing me to be shopping hereï¿½ ï¿½ if you donï¿½t want to scan the items, we can always just take the stuff and leave? Would that be alright?
ï¿½	When asking for help from floor employees, we receive the same exact treatment. It is an absolute inconvenience for a floor employee stacking shelves to just look up, acknowledge a client and point them vaguely in the direction of the shelf theyï¿½re looking for. Again ï¿½ we are really sorry to be such an inconvenience to you while youï¿½re busy with the absolutely critical and heavily complex task of stacking cans on a shelf, but we would dearly like to know where a certain item is, so that we may purchase it, and contribute to the store paying your salary. We are not asking for a red carpet and a crown, we are asking for basic manners and a little assistance. 

Sunday 16 January, my husband went to pick up some groceries at Shoprite Lady Grey and returned in such a state of shock and frustration it took an hour to calm down. 
The so-called express till is possibly the slowest till in the store, with a waiting time of 40 minutes, with 7 people in a queue. In contrast, when visiting OK Foods at Rembrandt Mall in Paarl, the queue can be standing across the store to the back at the dairy and the longest waiting time we have experienced was 15 MINUTES. This is shameful. 
When my husband realised he had forgotten 1 simple item, he returned to purchase it, thinking he will quickly get it from the cigarette counter. At the cigarette counter, which I have to point out is slow even at the best of times AND DOES NOT SELL STATIONERY a lady with an ENTIRE TROLLEY of back-to-school items was getting THE ENTIRE TROLLEY REFUNDED. 
WHY is this allowed at the cigarette counter? Why is there no-one else available in that massive store to assist with a refund, so other customers can be helped?
The gentleman in the queue with my husband abandoned his groceries in the store too, seeing as how they werenï¿½t about to be helped in this century still. 

This is what your lack of efficiency and poor management has caused:
ï¿½	 Massive stress and anxiety in an autistic person
ï¿½	The abandonment of items needed, which means we will now not only have to go spend MORE money than we would have initially if we were able to purchase what we needed at your store
ï¿½	An extra trip to a different store to purchase the needed items ï¿½ more fuel wasted, more time wasted

Here is my questions:
ï¿½	In a country riddled with unemployment, why do you not have any staff available?
ï¿½	Why is your available staff so poorly mannered and unhelpful?
ï¿½	Why are there only four till points open on a weekend, especially when there are specials on like Back-to-School?
ï¿½	Why is a trolley full of stationery allowed to take up an entire till point, effectively taking that counter ï¿½offlineï¿½ seeing as how it is also too much effort for a cashier to get a packet of cigarettes if one is paying at another counter, and you have to go stand in that line to be helped?
ï¿½	What if the item my husband needed to buy was urgent? What if, for example, someone had cut themselves and needed a plaster ï¿½ by the time the person buying the plaster re-emerged from the store, the person in the car has what, bled to death?
ï¿½	We live in a time where mental health is actually acknowledged ï¿½ so what if a paranoid schizophrenic has mustered the courage to buy a loaf of bread, and is experiencing an attack while waiting an hour in a line of five people, and freaks out? Maybe stabs someone? Attacks someone?  What happens when your lack of management and poor organization causes someone with severe anxiety or autism to have a meltdown in the store? Who is liable? 

When I stepped on my own car keys, in the parking lot ï¿½ not even inside the store ï¿½ because of my own clumsiness, and twisted my ankle, the staff could not have embarrassed me more. They had to fetch a wheelchair, take my blood pressure and then follow me around the store while I bought carrots and bread. It was my own fault, my own clumsiness, and I was fine. The staff was all over me, making a massive scene and causing a lot of embarrassment. 
But when we NEED ACTUAL ASSISTANCE there is none available. 
If it is such a massive inconvenience for you and your staff to assist people who are supporting your store, if we have to go somewhere else to buy items we need because the till is closed, the floor staff couldnï¿½t be bothered to help us find something, or the store is simply too panic-inducing, we will go somewhere else IN ANY EVENT and make sure to take as many people with us as we can.

Shoprite,WC Shoprite Division,Southern Suburbs Region,Shoprite Pelican Park,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Shoprite Responsive Web,Poor Customer Experience,"Hi there hope you guys are well. Yesterday, 28.01, I had to buy food for my family, well I planned on getting food and shoprite in pelican park because it was nearby. I was working till 19:00 and I got time to go there last night. I made it there at 19:48 because i checked the time on my phone and they were Closed, there were still people inside and I asked the security if I can't run inside yet and he said no, bearing in mind that the store is supposed to close at 20:00 only. I ended up going to fisherman's lane and buying food there instead which we all know fast foods is more expensive. Today I went to shoprite to pick up money for my dad that was sent from my brother and I went to the money market and I told them the time I was there last night and that they were closed, there was a coloured lady and a light of completion lady, only the 2 of them were cashiers at the money market and they refused that they weren't closed before 8, they both stood on the fact that they NEVER close before 8 because if they did they would get into trouble. I ended up not speaking to them anymore because I knew there was going to be a argument, as I know what I saw and the time i saw it, I even called my dad at 19:51 to tell him that the store had closed before 8 o clock. However that's not my problem, my problem is that the 2 cashiers today was In denial and that they should respect their customers and instead not Lie to me or gang up on me if I know I'm the one that is right, I'll attach the file of the screens hot that I took the time I phoned my dad, and the slip of the money that i drew today, unfortunately her name is not on the slip. Another thing, I got the money without using my I.D card which they normally ask for when you pick up money, and they never even asked for a password as they used to, so I don't know if the system changed or if that specific lady was just nonchalant about everything.",1367953,#,#,29/01/2022,Completed,Keturah Rangasami,Tyreece,Williams,+27 634144211,29/01/2022,Careline,91061

I've been a regular patron for over 4 years. Today was the first time I've ever had to have my receipt checked at the door and when I asked why the man grab my wrists and and pulled my receipt out of the plastic bag I was carrying. This has been building up for a while now and I tried my best to ignore it but today's altercation was humiliating to say the least being treated like a criminal in an establishment I frequently visit left a sour taste in my mouth. On more than one occasion I could tell the same security guard was following me around while I shopped I don't know if this is company policy but I feel all customers should be treated the same allowing guards to cherry pick and harass certain customers while others are treated with dignity is just wrong there needs to be consistent action for everyone. I have never stolen anything nor do I have a criminal record and what further compounds the matter is that this is only done to people of colour I want to understand whether it is normal for Shoprite to apply racial profiling and classism in the way security is handled we deserve to be treated equally,1323295,#,#,15/01/2022,Completed,Alize Feris,Luthando,Bam,+27 799220521,15/01/2022,Careline,96590

Shoprite Mini,Natal Shoprite Division,Zululand South Region,Shoprite Mini Ulundi,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,LONG QUEUES,Shoprite Responsive Web,Poor Customer Experience,"I frequently visit the said shop for different needs. 
What transpires there is a dynamic set of challenges that leads to almost none service .
This range from very poor employees' performance creating unnecessary long queues .
This occurs mainly at kiosk where money transfers, lotto, cigarettes are handled. 
I used to spend +/_ 2 hours on the queue. Sometimes just to find out that the intended service is not available. 
That could be easily avoided. 
Most the time just one person is allocated there for almost an endless queue of different services while there are more than one service points. 
This can be due to short stuff or very poor management. 
All the till points seems do not care of the very long queues looking at the slowly pace they move .
That can be due to incapacity of the employees,  the system used or very poor supervision/management. 
Worse when few till are opened while the queues are very long.
Clearly poor management. 
I recommend that lotto machine be removed or more personal be added .
For out of service or down times periods , this should be attended on the queue regularly to avoid queueing for nothing. 
The exhausted employee tends to loose temper and creates more challenges in her/his responses and activities to us as customers .
The till system should be upgraded to match the demand and the nowerday's operations.
Tills should be closely monitored to increase their opened number sooner it becomes necessary. 
To stay at Chechers the day long for a single service democrats very poor service/management for the well-known shop like Usave.

After asking how I was being inappropriate as my clothing showed no private parts of any kind and over the hot pants I had a mini tennis skirt on and a loose crop top shirt. In my knowledge inappropriate clothing means you are exposing private parts to the public., I should also express that I make my own clothes and I have had a problem before with a jump-suit I made myself before; where I was denied access even though I have seen people with store bought jumpsuits being let into the store. Today I was let in the store and later kicked out which means the security guard saw nothing wrong about my clothing until someone else commented. I would like say that I was deeply humiliated by this ordeal as an unknown man had to give me his shirt so I could continue shopping as I needed my banking pin for the transaction and no one saw a problem with him undressing in the store, or the Covid times we are living in. I have full footage of the ordeal.It is truly saddening that women cannot express themselves even though I make my own clothes, I have to wear my clothes to promote my business so I can be able to shop at Shoprite that is the only way I make money, this hurts as I recently went to Johannesburg; Braamfontein where I was dressed in the same outfit and I got purchase orders for the same outfit where people had a positive response to it not this dark cloud of hate that was surrounding me at your store.In closing I would like to let you know that I will be seeking legal guidance from a family lawyer and we will see how they advise me to continue with this matter.",1287105,#,#,03/01/2022,Completed,Estrolita September,Zimbali,Blom,+27 680042661,03/01/2022,Careline,35732

Usave,Northern Usave Division,Uu Pretoria North Region,Usave Danville,COMPLAINT,SERVICE,STAFF GENERAL,Usave Responsive Web,Poor customer experience,"Message: Good dayPlease be as kind as to retrainthe manager at this store. Costomer care to the manager, Humphrey means sitting in his office. It seems as if the external security officer knows more of what is happening in the store than him.There seem to be no responsability towards effecient customer flow, as there is NEVER more than 1 cashier onduty at the check out. The line of frustrated customers end up being up to 10 people long, wich creates an unHEALTHY, unsavoury shopping experience.I visit the shop out of absolute need to, not want to. Yesterday I entered the shop, once again out of need, going to the money counter. As I entered, there were no clients at the counter. The cashier, upon seeing and aknowledging me, then proceeded to lift his cash tray and disappear into the non- managers office ""to count his money"", ignoring me at the counter. At the single till point, 11 aggitated customers were being served by 1 rather unenthusiastic casier. After waiting several minutes, the security officer advised me to rather join the line of people and withdraw cash at the till.I wanted to see the manager at this point...but alas, as usual, no response.I cued, without social distancing being enforced by anyone, and waited and waited. After nearly 5 minutes, Humphrey emerged from his office clutching his cell phone.He did not pay any atyention to the problem, nor aknowledge that there is one.Not even when eventually, I had a chance to reach the cashier, only to be told that he doesn't have the correct money in his drawer for my withdrawel.By this time Humphrey, still clutching his phone, has disappeared back into his office, leaving the cashier to handle a bunch of neglected and frustrated customers. And still, there was not a soul in sight at the money market...If this was a once off occurance, I would not be investing my time to complain. This is unfortunately the umpteenth time.Furtermore, is there a standard setting prescribed to your shops for the aircon? This shop runs on anything between 25- 30 degrees daily. This results in aggitated clients and wilted (un)fresh produce.It is no use to put a new coat of paint onto a long broken item. Although I understand the concept of no big prices, no big marketing so Usave, I do firmly believe that customer satisfaction and care should be of highest priority in ANY circumstance.Awaiting your improvements.RegardsW.

I have had refunds done many times and I am now sick and tired of the same problem time after time.You Shoprite, publish your specials ad catalogues on the web monthly and weekly for us to access and we go to the nearest store but only to find what you advertised is not the price at the store. Why?? I always check whether the special price is applicable to gauteng stores before I go shopping but not all items will be at my branch. For e.g. this month/week's specials :Listerine is not R33 as advert shows but R39 (didnt buy)Eggs Ritebrand 30x not R55 but R63 (settled for 18x pack at R38)1L Ygt(fruits of forest/clover classic) not R24 but R33/R38Parmalat Ygt x6x 2 not R28 but normal price each (my till slip is proof and I swiped my XSavings card).Plus they didn't have the special prize on shelf on the fridge. This happens most times with popular items such as yoghurt esp now that schools are open.I know sometimes the prices advertised may only be for items at the  Shoprite Plaza branch but not this time.So can someone explain why????Is this a franchise issue???? Or a demand or stock levels issue??? Or a greed issue??? Or incompetence issue??? Or exploitation of blacks as in the old RSA.???I thought Shoprite was dedicated to help citizens esp poor and unemployed  ones in these tough economic times to access groceries, toiletries, ie basic necessities??Unhappy XSavings Customer????????Ponjo0829315890/0637961495PS: I do appreciate the price lockdown on most essential foods!!",1343355,#,#,23/01/2022,Completed,Estrolita September,Ponjo,Ledwaba,#,23/01/2022,Careline,59384

Now,I believe I can help increase that portion of organic traffic significantly at checkers.co.zaI believe you would like to come top on searches for keywords related to  checkers.co.za   ... I found a number of SEO issues such as broken links, page speed issue, HTML validation errors, images with no ALT text on your website, that's stopping you from getting that traffic.How about I fix those, and also promote you through engaging content on relevant places on the web (read, social media).I guarantee you will see a drastic change in your search ranking and traffic once these issues are fixed. Also, this is one time, so no paying AdWords every month.Is this something you are interested in?If yes, please allow me to send you a no obligation audit report and quote.Hoping to hear from you and take this partnership ahead.--Kind Regards,Lucy WilsonBusiness Analyst.PS 1: Please answer our email with ï¿½Interestedï¿½ or ï¿½Not Interestedï¿½ so that we will know the status of your inquiry and act accordingly.
